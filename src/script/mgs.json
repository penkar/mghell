All the missiles on these disposal sites are supposed to be dismantled. It's not that easy to get your hands on an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missle)."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That used to be true, but since the end of the Cold War you can get anything if you have enough money and the right connections."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So what exactly are they demanding?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"A person's remains."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Remains?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's right. To be more accurate, cell specimens which contain the individual's genomic information."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Cell specimens? Why would they want that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The terrorists need them. You see these Next-Generation Special Forces have been strengthened through gene therapy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Strengthened?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You've heard of the Human Genome Project. They've been mapping the human genome, and they're nearly finished. Following up on this research, the military has been working towards identifiying those genes which are responsible for making effective soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There are genes that do that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and using gene therapy they're able to transplant those genes into regular soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Gene therapy?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I'll explain this part. With gene therapy, we can remove those genes which we know may lead to sickness or disease, and that the same time, splice in genes with beneficial effects such as resistance to cancer for example."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"In other words, we can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases and at the same time add genetic characteristics as desired."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, and so if you knew what genes were responsible for making the perfect soldier, you could implant them in the same way, right?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes we could."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But it all depends on being able to isolate and identify those \"soldier genes\"."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And in order to do that, it's helpful to study the genomic information of one of the greatest soldiers ever."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One of the greatest soldiers ever?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The man they call the greatest warrior of the twentieth century."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You don't mean Big Boss?!"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right. We've been working feverishly to identify the genes responsible for his incredible combat skill. So far we've discovered about sixty of the so-called \"soldier genes.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"So his body was recovered after all."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and his cells have remained frozen in cryo-chamber. His genomic information is a priceless treasure to mankind."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Priceless to the military perhaps."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"His body was burned severely, but it was possible to restore his DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) profile from just a single strand of his hair."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You people are amazing. And then you're going to transplant those genes into soldiers?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. We'll use a process that I discovered called gene targeting. The strongest soldiers don't become what they are by acquiring their skills through training or experience, we now know that hereditary factors are far more crucial for creating superior soldiers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, we can't give them his body. It's potentially more dangerous than all the warheads on that island put together."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I hear the terrorists are calling themselves the \"Sons of Big Boss.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the time limit?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"24 hours. They say they'll launch after 24 hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did they say what the target will be?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"So far they haven't mentioned a target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"When did the countdown start?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"5 hours ago."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, who are you speaking for?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Naturally, I'm representing the US government."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So who's in supervisory control of this operation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The President of the United States."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Which means that the President must be meeting with his top aides in the map room about now, huh?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No at this point they're still video conferencing with each other."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If that's a real nuclear warhead, shouldn't they issue a COG (Continuity of Government)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Not yet. The Secretary of Defense has operational control and is fully aware of the situation. After you infiltrate, if you determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities a COG will be issued."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well if they haven't relocated to nuclear shelter under Mount Washingtion, I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet. Is the National Security Agency in on this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. So is the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The DIA? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They'll be sending us some support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We don't need desk jockies. We need a nuclear weapons specialist."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Of course. A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned to us."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We need backup from a specialist. I'm just an amateur when it comes to nuclear weapons."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I know. That's why I've requested the assistance of a military analyst named Nastasha Romanenko. She'll be providing you backup by Codec."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female analyst?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's built up an impressive record as an advisor to the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Contact her if you have any questions. She's also an expert on hi-tech weapons."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where's she working from?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"At her home in Los Angeles."},{"character":"Snake","line":"California. Seems like a million miles away."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How well-armed are these terrorists? I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They're heavily armed I'm afraid."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about they're battle experience."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The six members of FOX-HOUND in charge are all hardened veterans. They're tough enough to eat nails and ask for seconds."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The others are Next-Generation Special Forces. They're not your average grunts either."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They started out as an anti-terrorist special-ops unit made up of members from former biochem units, technical escort units, and the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Their purpose was to respond to threats involving next-generation weapons of mass destruction, including NBC (nuclear/biological/chemica) weapons."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Until \"they\" were added that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's \"they\"?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"These guys didn't start out as regular army."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a pretty international group. Mercenaries?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yeah. And it gets worse. Most of them were from a merc agency that I think you're familiar with. They were part of Big Boss' private guard. And after Big Boss went down, the military just bought out all their contracts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Outer Heaven."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"After that they were merged with our own VR unit, Force 21, and re-trained. If you ask me, these so-called \"Next-Generation Special Forces\" should to be called \"simulated soldiers.\" They have no real battle experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Video game players, huh?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy. They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers. Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by international law."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes, but those are just declarations not actual treaties."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit conspired in this attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"They're calling it a revolution."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Since they all went through the same gene therapy, they probably felt closer than brothers. They see the unit as their only family."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss. But if they were regular army, they must've been interviewed periodically by army counsellers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"According to their files, they all got straight A's on their psychological tests. They all seemed like fine, upstanding patriotic soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But they all took part in the uprising?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No. Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise. That's why there was a resupply of troops."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Apparently they consulted classified information about the soldier genes and performed their own gene therapy experiments."},{"character":"Snake","line":"They can do that even without you?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well our gene therapy process is almost completely automated. And besides that they're all geniuses with IQs over 180."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Even the existence of this genome army is a national secret of the highest order. We'd been hoping to investigate this quietly and deal with it behind closed doors."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Hi-Tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND. Your former unit, and one that I was a commander of. An elite group combining firepower and expertise. They're every bit as good as when I was commanding them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they're still around."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are six members of FOX-HOUND involved in this terrorist activity. Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities. Sniper Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter. Decoy Octopus, master of disguise. Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman. And Revolver Ocelot, specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a lovely bunch of folks. Too bad we'll be meeting under these circumstances."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"And finally, in charge of them, FOX-HOUND's squad leader Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake?!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes and you're the only person who can stand against him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Liquid Snake. The man with the same codename as you."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me what you know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager, the youngest person in the SAS (British Special Air Service).  His job was to track down and destroy mobile SCUD missile launching platforms. You were there too I believe. Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was just a kid myself back then."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The details are classified, but it seems that originally he penetrated the the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS."},{"character":"Snake","line":"He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But he never once showed his face in Century House. He was taken prisoner in Iraq, and after that there was no trace of him for several years. After you retired, he was rescued and became a member of FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using codenames."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know his real name. That information is so highly classified that even I can't look at it. Here's a photo of him.  Pretty shocking, huh?  His skin tone is a little different but otherwise you two are exact duplicates."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have a twin?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know the details, but it seems so. That's why we really need you for this mission."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're the only one who can beat him. Now that I've met you, I know. You've got something he doesn't. I can see it in your eyes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why don't I find that thought more comforting?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore. Let me go back to Twin Lakes."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Why Snake? Is your life in Alaska all that great?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's a dogsled race this week. Next Saturday I have to be in Anchorage."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The Iditarod? The longest sled race in the world? When did you become a dog musher?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Right now my fifty huskies are my only family. I've got to take care of them."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry about your dogs."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you mean?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry Snake but this vessel is headed for the Bering Sea. There's no room for debate."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I told you, even if I do owe you I don't anything to this army or this country!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You will accept this assignment!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why should I be stupid enough to do that? I'm no patriot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, there's enough dirt in your file from your days as an agent to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh I see. Blackmail."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No Snake. I prefer to look at it as helping you to come to a decision more easily. But anyway, I know you better than that. You'd take this assignment even without the threat."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why do you say that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You're a natural born soldier. You're not the grow old gracefully type. Same for all of us who've seen real action. The only place we can feel truly alive is on the battlefield. I'm a solider too. I know those feelings of powerlessness, frustration that you feel everyday. You've tried to play the boy scout out there in Alaska, but you can't race dogs in the snow forever.  Why don't you come back to us and be a soldier again."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You think my life is some kind of joke?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I just want to give you back your purpose in life."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're retired. Why are you involved in this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because there aren't many people who know FOX-HOUND as well as I do."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Is that really the only reason?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've been soldiering for a long time, I don't know anything else. I guess even though I'm getting a little old, I still love to be in the field."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're a lousy liar. Tell me the real reason."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Okay Snake. Sorry. I'll be frank. A person very dear to me is being held hostage."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who is it?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"My niece. Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What was your niece doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt. And my niece was one of those called in as an emergency replacement."},{"character":"Snake","line":"She looks like you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's my little brother's girl. He died in the Gulf War. Since then I've been watching after her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A personal motive, Colonel. That's not very soldierly."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm retired. I'm just an old man now. And I'm your friend."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Since when are we friends?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've thought of us as friends since the fall of Zanzibar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"With my personality I don't have too many friends."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's what I trust about you. It's what makes you human. Please Snake. Save my niece Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"All right, but I have two conditions."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Name them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One, no more secrets between us. I want complete disclosure at all times and two, I'll only accept orders from you, Colonel. No cutoffs involved okay?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Agreed. That's why I was called. But one thing."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not a colonel anymore. Just a retired old warhorse."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, Colonel."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That doctor. Is she part of this operation too?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She was in charge of FOX-HOUND's gene therapy. She knows more about those men than anyone else."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean you've seen them naked?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Make no mistake. I'm not a nurse. I'm a scientist."},{"character":"Snake","line":"By the way, what was that injection for?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It's a combination of and nanomachines and an anti-freezing peptide so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze, even at sub-arctic temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nanomachines?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Not just one kind either. There are different types which will replenish the supply of adrenaline, nutrition and sugar in your bloodstream."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Now I don't have to worry about food."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I also put some nootropics in there."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Say what?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Nootropics. It's a class of drugs which will help improve your mental functioning."},{"character":"Snake","line":"It'll make smarter huh? Anything else?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Benzedrine. It's a type of stimulant. It'll keep you alert and responsive for twelve straight hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That was quite a cocktail. Anything else in there?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Those nanomachines will also keep your Codec's batteries charged up."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're welcome."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I need to borrow your scissors."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"What are you going to do?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't worry.

Why would they want that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The terrorists need them. You see these Next-Generation Special Forces have been strengthened through gene therapy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Strengthened?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You've heard of the Human Genome Project. They've been mapping the human genome, and they're nearly finished. Following up on this research, the military has been working towards identifiying those genes which are responsible for making effective soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There are genes that do that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and using gene therapy they're able to transplant those genes into regular soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Gene therapy?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I'll explain this part. With gene therapy, we can remove those genes which we know may lead to sickness or disease, and that the same time, splice in genes with beneficial effects such as resistance to cancer for example."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"In other words, we can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases and at the same time add genetic characteristics as desired."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, and so if you knew what genes were responsible for making the perfect soldier, you could implant them in the same way, right?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes we could."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But it all depends on being able to isolate and identify those \"soldier genes\"."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And in order to do that, it's helpful to study the genomic information of one of the greatest soldiers ever."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One of the greatest soldiers ever?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The man they call the greatest warrior of the twentieth century."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You don't mean Big Boss?!"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right. We've been working feverishly to identify the genes responsible for his incredible combat skill. So far we've discovered about sixty of the so-called \"soldier genes.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"So his body was recovered after all."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and his cells have remained frozen in cryo-chamber. His genomic information is a priceless treasure to mankind."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Priceless to the military perhaps."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"His body was burned severely, but it was possible to restore his DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) profile from just a single strand of his hair."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You people are amazing. And then you're going to transplant those genes into soldiers?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. We'll use a process that I discovered called gene targeting. The strongest soldiers don't become what they are by acquiring their skills through training or experience, we now know that hereditary factors are far more crucial for creating superior soldiers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, we can't give them his body. It's potentially more dangerous than all the warheads on that island put together."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I hear the terrorists are calling themselves the \"Sons of Big Boss.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the time limit?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"24 hours. They say they'll launch after 24 hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did they say what the target will be?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"So far they haven't mentioned a target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"When did the countdown start?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"5 hours ago."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, who are you speaking for?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Naturally, I'm representing the US government."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So who's in supervisory control of this operation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The President of the United States."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Which means that the President must be meeting with his top aides in the map room about now, huh?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No at this point they're still video conferencing with each other."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If that's a real nuclear warhead, shouldn't they issue a COG (Continuity of Government)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Not yet. The Secretary of Defense has operational control and is fully aware of the situation. After you infiltrate, if you determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities a COG will be issued."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well if they haven't relocated to nuclear shelter under Mount Washingtion, I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet. Is the National Security Agency in on this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. So is the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The DIA? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They'll be sending us some support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We don't need desk jockies. We need a nuclear weapons specialist."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Of course. A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned to us."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We need backup from a specialist. I'm just an amateur when it comes to nuclear weapons."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I know. That's why I've requested the assistance of a military analyst named Nastasha Romanenko. She'll be providing you backup by Codec."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female analyst?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's built up an impressive record as an advisor to the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Contact her if you have any questions. She's also an expert on hi-tech weapons."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where's she working from?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"At her home in Los Angeles."},{"character":"Snake","line":"California. Seems like a million miles away."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How well-armed are these terrorists? I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They're heavily armed I'm afraid."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about they're battle experience."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The six members of FOX-HOUND in charge are all hardened veterans. They're tough enough to eat nails and ask for seconds."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The others are Next-Generation Special Forces. They're not your average grunts either."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They started out as an anti-terrorist special-ops unit made up of members from former biochem units, technical escort units, and the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Their purpose was to respond to threats involving next-generation weapons of mass destruction, including NBC (nuclear/biological/chemica) weapons."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Until \"they\" were added that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's \"they\"?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"These guys didn't start out as regular army."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a pretty international group. Mercenaries?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yeah. And it gets worse. Most of them were from a merc agency that I think you're familiar with. They were part of Big Boss' private guard. And after Big Boss went down, the military just bought out all their contracts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Outer Heaven."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"After that they were merged with our own VR unit, Force 21, and re-trained. If you ask me, these so-called \"Next-Generation Special Forces\" should to be called \"simulated soldiers.\" They have no real battle experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Video game players, huh?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy. They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers. Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by international law."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes, but those are just declarations not actual treaties."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit conspired in this attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"They're calling it a revolution."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Since they all went through the same gene therapy, they probably felt closer than brothers. They see the unit as their only family."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss. But if they were regular army, they must've been interviewed periodically by army counsellers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"According to their files, they all got straight A's on their psychological tests. They all seemed like fine, upstanding patriotic soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But they all took part in the uprising?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No. Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise. That's why there was a resupply of troops."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Apparently they consulted classified information about the soldier genes and performed their own gene therapy experiments."},{"character":"Snake","line":"They can do that even without you?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well our gene therapy process is almost completely automated. And besides that they're all geniuses with IQs over 180."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Even the existence of this genome army is a national secret of the highest order. We'd been hoping to investigate this quietly and deal with it behind closed doors."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Hi-Tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND. Your former unit, and one that I was a commander of. An elite group combining firepower and expertise. They're every bit as good as when I was commanding them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they're still around."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are six members of FOX-HOUND involved in this terrorist activity. Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities. Sniper Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter. Decoy Octopus, master of disguise. Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman. And Revolver Ocelot, specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a lovely bunch of folks. Too bad we'll be meeting under these circumstances."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"And finally, in charge of them, FOX-HOUND's squad leader Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake?!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes and you're the only person who can stand against him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Liquid Snake. The man with the same codename as you."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me what you know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager, the youngest person in the SAS (British Special Air Service).  His job was to track down and destroy mobile SCUD missile launching platforms. You were there too I believe. Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was just a kid myself back then."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The details are classified, but it seems that originally he penetrated the the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS."},{"character":"Snake","line":"He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But he never once showed his face in Century House. He was taken prisoner in Iraq, and after that there was no trace of him for several years. After you retired, he was rescued and became a member of FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using codenames."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know his real name. That information is so highly classified that even I can't look at it. Here's a photo of him.  Pretty shocking, huh?  His skin tone is a little different but otherwise you two are exact duplicates."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have a twin?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know the details, but it seems so. That's why we really need you for this mission."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're the only one who can beat him. Now that I've met you, I know. You've got something he doesn't. I can see it in your eyes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why don't I find that thought more comforting?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore. Let me go back to Twin Lakes."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Why Snake? Is your life in Alaska all that great?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's a dogsled race this week. Next Saturday I have to be in Anchorage."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The Iditarod? The longest sled race in the world? When did you become a dog musher?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Right now my fifty huskies are my only family. I've got to take care of them."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry about your dogs."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you mean?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry Snake but this vessel is headed for the Bering Sea. There's no room for debate."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I told you, even if I do owe you I don't anything to this army or this country!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You will accept this assignment!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why should I be stupid enough to do that? I'm no patriot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, there's enough dirt in your file from your days as an agent to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh I see. Blackmail."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No Snake. I prefer to look at it as helping you to come to a decision more easily. But anyway, I know you better than that. You'd take this assignment even without the threat."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why do you say that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You're a natural born soldier. You're not the grow old gracefully type. Same for all of us who've seen real action. The only place we can feel truly alive is on the battlefield. I'm a solider too. I know those feelings of powerlessness, frustration that you feel everyday. You've tried to play the boy scout out there in Alaska, but you can't race dogs in the snow forever.  Why don't you come back to us and be a soldier again."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You think my life is some kind of joke?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I just want to give you back your purpose in life."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're retired. Why are you involved in this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because there aren't many people who know FOX-HOUND as well as I do."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Is that really the only reason?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've been soldiering for a long time, I don't know anything else. I guess even though I'm getting a little old, I still love to be in the field."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're a lousy liar. Tell me the real reason."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Okay Snake. Sorry. I'll be frank. A person very dear to me is being held hostage."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who is it?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"My niece. Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What was your niece doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt. And my niece was one of those called in as an emergency replacement."},{"character":"Snake","line":"She looks like you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's my little brother's girl. He died in the Gulf War. Since then I've been watching after her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A personal motive, Colonel. That's not very soldierly."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm retired. I'm just an old man now. And I'm your friend."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Since when are we friends?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've thought of us as friends since the fall of Zanzibar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"With my personality I don't have too many friends."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's what I trust about you. It's what makes you human. Please Snake. Save my niece Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"All right, but I have two conditions."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Name them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One, no more secrets between us. I want complete disclosure at all times and two, I'll only accept orders from you, Colonel. No cutoffs involved okay?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Agreed. That's why I was called. But one thing."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not a colonel anymore. Just a retired old warhorse."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, Colonel."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That doctor. Is she part of this operation too?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She was in charge of FOX-HOUND's gene therapy. She knows more about those men than anyone else."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean you've seen them naked?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Make no mistake. I'm not a nurse. I'm a scientist."},{"character":"Snake","line":"By the way, what was that injection for?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It's a combination of and nanomachines and an anti-freezing peptide so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze, even at sub-arctic temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nanomachines?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Not just one kind either. There are different types which will replenish the supply of adrenaline, nutrition and sugar in your bloodstream."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Now I don't have to worry about food."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I also put some nootropics in there."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Say what?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Nootropics. It's a class of drugs which will help improve your mental functioning."},{"character":"Snake","line":"It'll make smarter huh? Anything else?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Benzedrine. It's a type of stimulant. It'll keep you alert and responsive for twelve straight hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That was quite a cocktail. Anything else in there?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Those nanomachines will also keep your Codec's batteries charged up."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're welcome."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I need to borrow your scissors."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"What are you going to do?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't worry. Just going to clean myself up a little."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Huh?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't want to be mistaken for the leader of the terrorists."},{"character":"action","line":""},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake swims through the lower dock of the disposal facility.  We see a man riding up the cargo elevator.)"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Stay alert!  He'll be through here, I know it.  I'm going to go swat down a couple of bothersome flies."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake removes his flippers and calls Campbell on the codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"This is Snake.  Colonel, can you hear me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Loud and clear Snake.  What's the situation?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Just as I expected.  You'll have to take the elevator to the surface.  But make sure that nobody sees you.  If you need to contact me by codec, the frequency is 140.85.  When you want to use the codec push the Select button. When we need to contact you the codec will beep.  When you hear that noise push the Select button. The codec directly stimulates the small bones of your ear, no one but you will be able to hear it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Got it, okay, I'm ready to go."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake takes off his scuba gear and watches the landscape slide by as the elevator ascends.  The title appears on the screen \"Metal Gear Solid\".  The elevator stops and Snake quickly runs out and looks for cover behind a storage crate.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It's Snake.  I'm in front of the disposal facility."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Excellent, Snake.  Age hasn't slowed you down one bit."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How's that Sneaking Suit working out?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm nice and dry, but it is a little hard to move."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Bear with it.  It's designed to prevent hypothermia.  This is Alaska you know."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Take it easy, I'm grateful.  If it wasn't for your suit and your shot I would have turned into a popsicle out there."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"An anti-freezing peptide Snake.  All of the Genome soldiers in this exercise are using it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm relieved to hear that.  Already tested, huh?  By the way, how's the diversionary operation going?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.  The terrorist's radar should have picked them up by now."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake peers out from behind the crate and sees a group of terrorists by a helicopter.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"A Hind D?  Colonel, what's a Russian gunship doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I have no idea...but it looks like our little diversion got their attention.  Now's your best chance to slip in unnoticed."},{"character":"action","line":"(The helicopter takes off, throwing snow in all directions, the guards on the ground shield their eyes as they follow it up into the sky.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are only 18 hours left until their deadline.  You've got to hurry."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Wow...you must be crazy to fly a Hind in this kind of weather."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Oh sorry, I haven't introduced you two yet.  This is Mei Ling.  She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist. She designed your codec, as well as your Soliton radar system. Contact her if you have any questions about either of them."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Nice to meet you Snake.  It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"What's wrong?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nothing...I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so...cute."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"You're just flattering me..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, I'm serious.  Now I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"C'mon, I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake... But I'm surprised, you're very frank for a trained killer."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting the man behind the legend...but first, let me explain about your Soliton radar system."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"The bright dot in the middle is you Snake.  The red dots are your enemies and the blue cone shape represents their field of vision."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Be careful Snake. The Genome soldiers have highly developed senses of hearing and vision due to their gene therapy.  Make sure you don't let them see you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"First I want you to infiltrate the disposal site and look for the DARPA Chief."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The DARPA Chief was injected with the same GPS transmitting nanomachines as you."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"He should appear on your radar as a green dot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Get whatever information you can from him about the terrorists.  If he's alive that is..."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Snake, your radar isn't affected by the weather, but if you're discovered by an enemy you won't be able to use it."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, it gets jammed easily I'm afraid."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Yes, it's all made from currently existing technology.  You won't be able to use it in an area with strong harmonic resonance.  So be careful."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll be monitoring your movements by radar... so contact us by Codec anytime  you want."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Got it.  I'll call if I'm feeling lonely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Seriously Snake.  We're here to back you up, so call if you need some information or advice."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"I'm also in charge of your mission data.  Contact me if you want me to record your current status.  My frequency is 140.96.  It's a dedicated frequency for saving data.  Don't forget it."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Remember, except for your binoculars you're naked.  You need to arm yourself with whatever weapons you can find."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember.  First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here, and then all my weapons are taken away.  Imagine yourself put in that position."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well, if yck in one you make it back in one piece, maybe I'll let you do a strip search on me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll hold you to that doctor.  By the way, sorry to dissapoint you but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How did you do that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"In my stomach.  Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach acids."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Cigarettes?  How are those going to help you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You never know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"If you want to get in, there's the front door."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake pulls out his binoculars and takes a look.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"It's the fastest way, but there's too much risk of being spotted by the enemy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't just knock on the door and ask them to let me in.

What are you doing here?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some peace and quiet.  I'm in retirement just like you.  Once in a while I still help train the Alaskan Scouts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Campbell told me about the situation here.

We were conducting excercises of a new type of experimental weapon. A weapon that will change the world."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"A weapon with the ability to launch a nuclear attack from any place on the face of the earth.

You don't like shots?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake listen up. It all went down five hours ago. Heavily armed soliders occupied Shadow Moses Island, a remote island off the coast of Alaska."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What soldiers?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Next-Generation Special Forces led by members of unit FOX-HOUND. They've presented Washington with a single demand, and they say that if it isn't met, they'll launch a nuclear weapon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A nuclear weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. You see, the island is the site of a secret nuclear weapons disposal facility."},{"character":"Snake","line":"FOX-HOUND hijacking a nuclear weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Now you understand how serious the situation is. You'll have two mission objectives. First, you're to rescue the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Chief, Donald Anderson, and the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker. They're both being held as hostages."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Those are some heavy duty hostages."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Secondly, you're to investigate whether or not the terrorists have the ability to launch a nuclear strike, and stop them if they do. Any questions, Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Questions? I haven't even said whether I'd accept this mission."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well you can make up your mind after you hear more about the situation."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about the nuclear weapons disposal facility."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The disposal facility includes a hardened underground base. Even with our most advanced intelligence gathering equipment, we can't tell what's happening inside."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So someone needs to penetrate, gather intelligence, and report back... Sounds like a spy movie. What's the insertion method?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well an air insertion is impossible."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Not with this storm going on."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll approach the disposal facility by sub."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Approach?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, within a few miles of it. The facility is equipped with sonar detection capability. They'd be able to hear our engine or propeller noise."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And then?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll launch a one-man SDV (swimmer delivery vehicle)."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Launch?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Same as a torpedo. Only this has no propulsion device of its own. After the SDV gets as close as it can, dispose of it. From there on you'll have to swim."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You want me to swim in sub-zero Alaskan water?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry. That suit represents the latest advances in poly- thermal technology. The nuclear weapons disposal facility covers the whole island. I'll contact you by Codec after you reach your target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Anyone going with me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"As usual, this is a one-man inflitration mission."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Weapons and equipment OSP (on-site procurement)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. This a top-secret black op. Don't expect any official support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Chief of DARPA and the president of an arms manufacturing company... what business did they have at a nuclear weapons disposal facility?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The truth is that secret exercises were being conducted at the time the terrorist group attacked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Must be extremely important exercises if those two were directly involved. Were they testing some kind of new advanced weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not privy to that information."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do we know exactly where they're being held?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The DARPA chief has also been injected with a mini-transmitter. As you get closer you should be able to pick up his location on your radar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do they really have the ability to launch a nuclear missile?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They say they do. They even gave us the serial number of the warhead they plan to use."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was the number confirmed?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. At the very least, they've got their hands on a real nuclear warhead."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Isn't there some kind of safety device to prevent this kind of terrorism?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. Every missile and warhead in our arsenal is equipped with a PAL, which uses a discreet detonation code."},{"character":"Snake","line":"PAL?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Permissive Action Link. A safety control system built into all nuclear weapons systems. But even so, we can't rest easy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why not?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because the DARPA Chief knows the detonation code."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But even if they have a nuclear warhead, it must've been removed from its missile. All the missiles on these disposal sites are supposed to be dismantled. It's not that easy to get your hands on an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missle)."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That used to be true, but since the end of the Cold War you can get anything if you have enough money and the right connections."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So what exactly are they demanding?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"A person's remains."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Remains?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's right. To be more accurate, cell specimens which contain the individual's genomic information."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Cell specimens? Why would they want that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The terrorists need them. You see these Next-Generation Special Forces have been strengthened through gene therapy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Strengthened?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You've heard of the Human Genome Project. They've been mapping the human genome, and they're nearly finished. Following up on this research, the military has been working towards identifiying those genes which are responsible for making effective soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There are genes that do that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and using gene therapy they're able to transplant those genes into regular soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Gene therapy?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I'll explain this part. With gene therapy, we can remove those genes which we know may lead to sickness or disease, and that the same time, splice in genes with beneficial effects such as resistance to cancer for example."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"In other words, we can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases and at the same time add genetic characteristics as desired."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, and so if you knew what genes were responsible for making the perfect soldier, you could implant them in the same way, right?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes we could."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But it all depends on being able to isolate and identify those \"soldier genes\"."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And in order to do that, it's helpful to study the genomic information of one of the greatest soldiers ever."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One of the greatest soldiers ever?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The man they call the greatest warrior of the twentieth century."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You don't mean Big Boss?!"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right. We've been working feverishly to identify the genes responsible for his incredible combat skill. So far we've discovered about sixty of the so-called \"soldier genes.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"So his body was recovered after all."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and his cells have remained frozen in cryo-chamber. His genomic information is a priceless treasure to mankind."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Priceless to the military perhaps."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"His body was burned severely, but it was possible to restore his DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) profile from just a single strand of his hair."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You people are amazing. And then you're going to transplant those genes into soldiers?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. We'll use a process that I discovered called gene targeting. The strongest soldiers don't become what they are by acquiring their skills through training or experience, we now know that hereditary factors are far more crucial for creating superior soldiers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, we can't give them his body. It's potentially more dangerous than all the warheads on that island put together."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I hear the terrorists are calling themselves the \"Sons of Big Boss.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the time limit?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"24 hours. They say they'll launch after 24 hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did they say what the target will be?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"So far they haven't mentioned a target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"When did the countdown start?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"5 hours ago."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, who are you speaking for?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Naturally, I'm representing the US government."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So who's in supervisory control of this operation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The President of the United States."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Which means that the President must be meeting with his top aides in the map room about now, huh?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No at this point they're still video conferencing with each other."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If that's a real nuclear warhead, shouldn't they issue a COG (Continuity of Government)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Not yet. The Secretary of Defense has operational control and is fully aware of the situation. After you infiltrate, if you determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities a COG will be issued."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well if they haven't relocated to nuclear shelter under Mount Washingtion, I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet. Is the National Security Agency in on this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. So is the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The DIA? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They'll be sending us some support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We don't need desk jockies. We need a nuclear weapons specialist."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Of course. A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned to us."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We need backup from a specialist. I'm just an amateur when it comes to nuclear weapons."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I know. That's why I've requested the assistance of a military analyst named Nastasha Romanenko. She'll be providing you backup by Codec."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female analyst?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's built up an impressive record as an advisor to the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Contact her if you have any questions. She's also an expert on hi-tech weapons."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where's she working from?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"At her home in Los Angeles."},{"character":"Snake","line":"California. Seems like a million miles away."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How well-armed are these terrorists? I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They're heavily armed I'm afraid."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about they're battle experience."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The six members of FOX-HOUND in charge are all hardened veterans. They're tough enough to eat nails and ask for seconds."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The others are Next-Generation Special Forces. They're not your average grunts either."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They started out as an anti-terrorist special-ops unit made up of members from former biochem units, technical escort units, and the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Their purpose was to respond to threats involving next-generation weapons of mass destruction, including NBC (nuclear/biological/chemica) weapons."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Until \"they\" were added that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's \"they\"?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"These guys didn't start out as regular army."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a pretty international group. Mercenaries?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yeah. And it gets worse. Most of them were from a merc agency that I think you're familiar with. They were part of Big Boss' private guard. And after Big Boss went down, the military just bought out all their contracts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Outer Heaven."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"After that they were merged with our own VR unit, Force 21, and re-trained. If you ask me, these so-called \"Next-Generation Special Forces\" should to be called \"simulated soldiers.\" They have no real battle experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Video game players, huh?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy. They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers. Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by international law."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes, but those are just declarations not actual treaties."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit conspired in this attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"They're calling it a revolution."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Since they all went through the same gene therapy, they probably felt closer than brothers. They see the unit as their only family."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss. But if they were regular army, they must've been interviewed periodically by army counsellers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"According to their files, they all got straight A's on their psychological tests. They all seemed like fine, upstanding patriotic soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But they all took part in the uprising?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No. Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise. That's why there was a resupply of troops."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Apparently they consulted classified information about the soldier genes and performed their own gene therapy experiments."},{"character":"Snake","line":"They can do that even without you?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well our gene therapy process is almost completely automated. And besides that they're all geniuses with IQs over 180."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Even the existence of this genome army is a national secret of the highest order. We'd been hoping to investigate this quietly and deal with it behind closed doors."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Hi-Tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND. Your former unit, and one that I was a commander of. An elite group combining firepower and expertise. They're every bit as good as when I was commanding them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they're still around."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are six members of FOX-HOUND involved in this terrorist activity. Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities. Sniper Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter. Decoy Octopus, master of disguise. Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman. And Revolver Ocelot, specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a lovely bunch of folks. Too bad we'll be meeting under these circumstances."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"And finally, in charge of them, FOX-HOUND's squad leader Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake?!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes and you're the only person who can stand against him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Liquid Snake. The man with the same codename as you."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me what you know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager, the youngest person in the SAS (British Special Air Service).  His job was to track down and destroy mobile SCUD missile launching platforms. You were there too I believe. Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was just a kid myself back then."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The details are classified, but it seems that originally he penetrated the the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS."},{"character":"Snake","line":"He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But he never once showed his face in Century House. He was taken prisoner in Iraq, and after that there was no trace of him for several years. After you retired, he was rescued and became a member of FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using codenames."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know his real name. That information is so highly classified that even I can't look at it. Here's a photo of him.  Pretty shocking, huh?  His skin tone is a little different but otherwise you two are exact duplicates."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have a twin?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know the details, but it seems so. That's why we really need you for this mission."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're the only one who can beat him. Now that I've met you, I know. You've got something he doesn't. I can see it in your eyes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why don't I find that thought more comforting?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore. Let me go back to Twin Lakes."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Why Snake? Is your life in Alaska all that great?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's a dogsled race this week. Next Saturday I have to be in Anchorage."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The Iditarod? The longest sled race in the world? When did you become a dog musher?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Right now my fifty huskies are my only family. I've got to take care of them."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry about your dogs."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you mean?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry Snake but this vessel is headed for the Bering Sea. There's no room for debate."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I told you, even if I do owe you I don't anything to this army or this country!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You will accept this assignment!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why should I be stupid enough to do that? I'm no patriot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, there's enough dirt in your file from your days as an agent to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh I see. Blackmail."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No Snake. I prefer to look at it as helping you to come to a decision more easily. But anyway, I know you better than that. You'd take this assignment even without the threat."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why do you say that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You're a natural born soldier. You're not the grow old gracefully type. Same for all of us who've seen real action. The only place we can feel truly alive is on the battlefield. I'm a solider too. I know those feelings of powerlessness, frustration that you feel everyday. You've tried to play the boy scout out there in Alaska, but you can't race dogs in the snow forever.  Why don't you come back to us and be a soldier again."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You think my life is some kind of joke?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I just want to give you back your purpose in life."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're retired. Why are you involved in this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because there aren't many people who know FOX-HOUND as well as I do."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Is that really the only reason?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've been soldiering for a long time, I don't know anything else. I guess even though I'm getting a little old, I still love to be in the field."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're a lousy liar. Tell me the real reason."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Okay Snake. Sorry. I'll be frank. A person very dear to me is being held hostage."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who is it?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"My niece. Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What was your niece doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt. And my niece was one of those called in as an emergency replacement."},{"character":"Snake","line":"She looks like you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's my little brother's girl. He died in the Gulf War. Since then I've been watching after her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A personal motive, Colonel. That's not very soldierly."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm retired. I'm just an old man now. And I'm your friend."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Since when are we friends?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've thought of us as friends since the fall of Zanzibar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"With my personality I don't have too many friends."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's what I trust about you. It's what makes you human. Please Snake. Save my niece Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"All right, but I have two conditions."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Name them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One, no more secrets between us. I want complete disclosure at all times and two, I'll only accept orders from you, Colonel. No cutoffs involved okay?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Agreed. That's why I was called. But one thing."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not a colonel anymore. Just a retired old warhorse."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, Colonel."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That doctor. Is she part of this operation too?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She was in charge of FOX-HOUND's gene therapy. She knows more about those men than anyone else."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean you've seen them naked?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Make no mistake. I'm not a nurse. I'm a scientist."},{"character":"Snake","line":"By the way, what was that injection for?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It's a combination of and nanomachines and an anti-freezing peptide so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze, even at sub-arctic temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nanomachines?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Not just one kind either. There are different types which will replenish the supply of adrenaline, nutrition and sugar in your bloodstream."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Now I don't have to worry about food."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I also put some nootropics in there."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Say what?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Nootropics. It's a class of drugs which will help improve your mental functioning."},{"character":"Snake","line":"It'll make smarter huh? Anything else?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Benzedrine. It's a type of stimulant. It'll keep you alert and responsive for twelve straight hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That was quite a cocktail. Anything else in there?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Those nanomachines will also keep your Codec's batteries charged up."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're welcome."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I need to borrow your scissors."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"What are you going to do?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't worry. Just going to clean myself up a little."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Huh?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't want to be mistaken for the leader of the terrorists."},{"character":"action","line":""},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake swims through the lower dock of the disposal facility.  We see a man riding up the cargo elevator.)"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Stay alert!  He'll be through here, I know it.  I'm going to go swat down a couple of bothersome flies."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake removes his flippers and calls Campbell on the codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"This is Snake.  Colonel, can you hear me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Loud and clear Snake.  What's the situation?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Just as I expected.  You'll have to take the elevator to the surface.  But make sure that nobody sees you.  If you need to contact me by codec, the frequency is 140.85.  When you want to use the codec push the Select button. When we need to contact you the codec will beep.  When you hear that noise push the Select button. The codec directly stimulates the small bones of your ear, no one but you will be able to hear it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Got it, okay, I'm ready to go."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake takes off his scuba gear and watches the landscape slide by as the elevator ascends.  The title appears on the screen \"Metal Gear Solid\".  The elevator stops and Snake quickly runs out and looks for cover behind a storage crate.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It's Snake.  I'm in front of the disposal facility."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Excellent, Snake.  Age hasn't slowed you down one bit."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How's that Sneaking Suit working out?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm nice and dry, but it is a little hard to move."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Bear with it.  It's designed to prevent hypothermia.  This is Alaska you know."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Take it easy, I'm grateful.  If it wasn't for your suit and your shot I would have turned into a popsicle out there."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"An anti-freezing peptide Snake.  All of the Genome soldiers in this exercise are using it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm relieved to hear that.  Already tested, huh?  By the way, how's the diversionary operation going?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.  The terrorist's radar should have picked them up by now."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake peers out from behind the crate and sees a group of terrorists by a helicopter.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"A Hind D?  Colonel, what's a Russian gunship doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I have no idea...but it looks like our little diversion got their attention.  Now's your best chance to slip in unnoticed."},{"character":"action","line":"(The helicopter takes off, throwing snow in all directions, the guards on the ground shield their eyes as they follow it up into the sky.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are only 18 hours left until their deadline.  You've got to hurry."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Wow...you must be crazy to fly a Hind in this kind of weather."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Oh sorry, I haven't introduced you two yet.  This is Mei Ling.  She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist. She designed your codec, as well as your Soliton radar system. Contact her if you have any questions about either of them."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Nice to meet you Snake.  It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"What's wrong?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nothing...I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so...cute."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"You're just flattering me..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, I'm serious.  Now I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"C'mon, I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake... But I'm surprised, you're very frank for a trained killer."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting the man behind the legend...but first, let me explain about your Soliton radar system."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"The bright dot in the middle is you Snake.  The red dots are your enemies and the blue cone shape represents their field of vision."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Be careful Snake. The Genome soldiers have highly developed senses of hearing and vision due to their gene therapy.  Make sure you don't let them see you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"First I want you to infiltrate the disposal site and look for the DARPA Chief."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The DARPA Chief was injected with the same GPS transmitting nanomachines as you."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"He should appear on your radar as a green dot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Get whatever information you can from him about the terrorists.  If he's alive that is..."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Snake, your radar isn't affected by the weather, but if you're discovered by an enemy you won't be able to use it."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, it gets jammed easily I'm afraid."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Yes, it's all made from currently existing technology.  You won't be able to use it in an area with strong harmonic resonance.  So be careful."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll be monitoring your movements by radar... so contact us by Codec anytime  you want."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Got it.  I'll call if I'm feeling lonely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Seriously Snake.  We're here to back you up, so call if you need some information or advice."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"I'm also in charge of your mission data.  Contact me if you want me to record your current status.  My frequency is 140.96.  It's a dedicated frequency for saving data.  Don't forget it."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Remember, except for your binoculars you're naked.  You need to arm yourself with whatever weapons you can find."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember.  First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here, and then all my weapons are taken away.  Imagine yourself put in that position."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well, if yck in one you make it back in one piece, maybe I'll let you do a strip search on me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll hold you to that doctor.  By the way, sorry to dissapoint you but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How did you do that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"In my stomach.  Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach acids."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Cigarettes?  How are those going to help you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You never know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"If you want to get in, there's the front door."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake pulls out his binoculars and takes a look.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"It's the fastest way, but there's too much risk of being spotted by the enemy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't just knock on the door and ask them to let me in.  One sentry on the left and one on the right.  They're armed with \"five five sixers\" and pineapples..."},{"character":"action","line":"(As the guard on the right approaches Snake puts back his binoculars and hides behind the crate again.  Then he goes over to the left and pulls out his binoculars again.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"What about the air duct near the door?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake locates the duct but it is guarded, he pans up to the upper level of the facility.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There should also be a duct on the second floor."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake looks across to the walkway on the second floor to find the vent but his view is blocked by the railing.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't see it from here."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake lowers his binoculars and once again hides behind the crate.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'll let you decide the best COA.  I'm counting on you Snake."},{"character":"action","line":"(The game resumes and the player takes control.  Eventually, Snake enters the vent on the second floor of the facility, he gets a codec call from Master Miller, his old instructor.)"},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake, it's been a long time."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Master?  What are you doing here?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some peace and quiet.  I'm in retirement just like you.  Once in a while I still help train the Alaskan Scouts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Campbell told me about the situation here.  I thought I might be of some use."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you."},{"character":"Master","line":"Well, I know lots about survival in a harsh environment.  I've lived in Alaska longer than you, so call me if you have any questions about the flora or fauna out here.

They're about to start spraying for rats."},{"character":"Snake","line":"1st floor basement ventilation shaft..."},{"character":"Genome 1","line":"Shut those covers as soon as they're done spraying.  Also, keep your eye on that woman in the cell.  Don't get careless now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Woman in the cell?"},{"character":"Genome 2","line":"Did something happen?"},{"character":"Genome 1","line":"There's an intruder."},{"character":"Genome 2","line":"Really?"},{"character":"Genome 1","line":"He's already done three people."},{"character":"Genome 2","line":"He's killed three people?"},{"character":"Genome 1","line":"Yeah.  They say he's using stealth too."},{"character":"Genome 2","line":"Stealth?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's an intruder besides me?"},{"character":"Genome 1","line":"Anyway, I want you to increase the security detail on the chief."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake finds the DARPA chief in his cell and drops down through a vent opening.)"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"Who... who, who's that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm here to save you.  You're the DARPA Chief, Donald Anderson, right?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"You're here to save me, huh?  What's your outfit?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm the pawn they sent here to save your worthless butt."},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"Really?  It's true... You don't look like one of them.  In that case, hurry up and get me out of here."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Slow down.  Don't worry.  First I want some information... about the terrorists."},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"The terrorists?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do they really have the ability to launch a nuke?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"What are you talking about?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"The terrorists are threatening the White House.  They say if they don't accede to their demands they'll launch a nuclear weapon."},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"Sweet Jesus..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Is it possible?!"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"... It's possible.  They... could launch a nuke."},{"character":"action","line":"(The woman in the next cell here this bit of information and stops the sit-ups she was doing.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"How do they plan to launch?  I though this place was just for keeping the dismantled warheads.  THey shouldn't have access to a missile..."},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"What I'm about to tell you is classified information. Okay?  We were conducting excercises of a new type of experimental weapon. A weapon that will change the world."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"A weapon with the ability to launch a nuclear attack from any place on the face of the earth.  A nuclear equipped, walking battle tank."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Metal Gear!?  It can't be!"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"... You knew!?  Metal Gear is one of the most secret black projects!  How did you know that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"We've had a couple of run-ins in the past.

Sut up in there willya!"},{"character":"action","line":"(The DARPA chief waves him away, and Snake comes out from his hiding place by the doorway.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"But I thought that all nuclear watheads were equipped with safety measures.  Some kind of detonation code that you have to input."},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"Oh, you mean PAL.  Yes, of course, there is a PAL.  It's set up so that you need to input two different passwords in order to launch the device."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There are two passwords?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"Yes.  Baker knows one and I know one."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Baker?  The president of ArmsTech?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"That's right.  Each of us has to input our password or there can be no launch.

You can stop the launch."},{"character":"action","line":"(The woman in the next cell hears this.)"},{"character":"Woman","line":"That card key... ?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"So where are the keys?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"Baker should have them.

You... you're from the Pentagon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Answer my question!  What about your code!?  There's no time!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I... talked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What!

Oh, don't be a fool."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Anyway, the terrorists have both codes now."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Those boys are totally insane.

Maybe they're like us in the arms industry... always looking forward to the next good war."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well I'm not going to let these maniacs start a war toady.

Who!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"A soldier that was thrown in prison along with me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female soldier?  It must be..."},{"character":"Baker","line":"She said that she had just joined up as a new recruit.

I hope she's okay."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sure she is.  She's green... but as tough as they come.  But how did you know she escaped?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I was in contact with her by Codec.  Until I was tied up here that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Codec?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  She stole it from the guard.  If she still has it, you should be able to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sure she still has it.  What frequency was she at?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh yeah.  Let me tell you.  It's..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker is struggling to remember.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Huh?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...Oh... sorry... I forgot..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh that's right!  It should be on the back of the CD case.  Try to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll contact her right away.  But tell me... If this doesn't work, is there some other way to prevent the missile launch?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Hmmm.  You need to find Hal Emmerich, one of my employees."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The team leader of the Metal Gear Rex project.  A genius at engineering, but a little bit of an oddball.  If there is anyone who can figure out how to stop Metal Gear from launching, it's him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What if he can't come up with anything?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You'll have to destroy it.  Emmerich knows how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where is this Emmerich?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Well... he's probably being held somewhere in the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building.  It's north from here.  That's where he worked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, but... why Metal Gear?  The Nuclear Age ended with the turn of the millenium."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You're wrong.  The threat of nuclear war isn't gone... in fact it's greater than it's ever been."},{"character":"action","line":"(Scenes of missile launches, storage buildings, and missile silos are shown.)"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The amount of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium is increasing even today.  Listen, have you ever seen a warehouse full of nuclear material?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...No."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Drums and drums of nuclear waste stacked this high.  As far as you can see because there's still no real way to dispose of the stuff."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they just close the lid and pretend like it'll go away?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Essentially, yes.  And they're not even doing a good job of storing it.  Many of the drums are corroded... with nuclear waste seeping out of them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Unbelievable."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Not only that, several pounds of MUF are reported every year."},{"character":"Snake","line":"MUF?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"It stands for \"material unnacounted for\". It proves that there is a large and well organized black market in nuclear materials. Furthermore, since the end of the Cold War, Russian nuclear engineers, in particular, are out of work with nowhere to turn."},{"character":"action","line":"(We go back to the chamber where Snake and Baker are conversing.)"},{"character":"Baker","line":"In other words, there is plenty of nuclear material and scientists for making a bomb.  We live in an age when any small country can have a nuclear weapons program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about the other superpowers?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Russia and China still maintain a signifigant nuclear presence. Complete nuclear disarmament is an impossibility.  To maintain our own policy of deterrance, we need a weapon of overwhelming power."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean Metal Gear."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You know our industry suffered quite a blow as a result of the cut-backs in military budgets, due to this so called \"peace\"."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember hearing a lot about mergers and take-overs among the big weapons makers."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  And after my company lost their bid to produce the Air Force's next fighter jet, the Metal Gear project was out last ace in the hole.  That's why we pushed to have Metal Gear developed as a black project."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Black project?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Secret projects paid for by the Pentagon's black budget.  You can avoid a lot of red tape a get a great lead-time on your weapons production.  And no one can bother you.  Not even those bleeding heart liberals on the military oversight committee."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Bribes."},{"character":"Baker","line":"I prefer to think of it as good buisness.  Anyway, Metal Gear was going to be formally adopted after the results of this exercise were analyzed."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't give a crap about you and your company."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes, that's about what I'd expect from a grunt like you... Here, this is what you came for, right?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker fishes a disc out of his pocket and hands it to Snake.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"An optical disk.  It's all here.  The main hard drive was destroyed by gunfire.  This is the only remaining copy of the data."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What kind of data?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"All the data collected from this exercise.  Don't play dumb.  I know you were sent to get this.  I hid it from that sadistic maniac while he was torturing me.  They don't know that this disk exists. Make sure that you report this to Jim... to your boss.  I'll give you my card too.  It'll open up all level two security doors."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Can you walk?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...No ...You go on without me.  They got my password... they don't want anything else from me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have one more question.  Who or what was that ninja thing?  It looked like you knew something."},{"character":"Baker","line":"That ninja?  That was FOX-HOUND's dark little secret."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Dark little secret?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"An experimantal... genome... soldier..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker coughs once more.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You know him?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You should ask Dr. Naomi Hunter from FOX-HOUND.  She knows better than I."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You've got to stop them.  If it goes public, my company and I are... finished."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?  Doesn't Metal Gear use currently existing technology?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Metal Gear itself does, but..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker bends over in pain.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Huh!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"What... what did you do to me!?  Uh... oooh...no!  ...Ooh.  Oh no, it can't be! ...those Pentagon bastards!  ...So they...they actually went ahead and did it!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"They... they're just... using you for... uuuhhh..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker slumps over and Snake stands in front of him stunned and confused.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What the hell?"},{"character":"action","line":"(After thinking for a moment he calls Campbell on the Codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel!  Are you listening?  Now he's dead too!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"...I have no idea!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't lie to me!"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It looked like another heart attcak but..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Some kind of poison!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well, there are a lot of drugs that can cause a heart attack in large doses.  For example. potassium chloride or dioxides... But... we won't be able to tell without doing an autopsy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I want you and Meryl to work together!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Can I trust her?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"...More than you can trust me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Get in contact with her."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Snake, there is a lot of electrical interferance coming from there.

Just exactly who are you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm the fool that your uncle sent all alone into the middle of this whole mess."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You came by yourself?  You think you're some kind of one-man army? You're not even armed."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I appreciate your help from before.  But... I don't need lectures.

Could you be Snake?  Are you Solid Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"That's what some people called me."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"The legendary Solid Snake...!  You!?  Sorry about before.

The reality is no match for the legend, I'm afraid."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I don't believe that."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why did you look surprised when you saw my face?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Because you look just like him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...You mean the terrorists leader, Liquid Snake?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Yeah, you know him?  You're not brothers are you!?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have no family."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"So, what's the deal then?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who knows.  Why don't you ask him?  But first I want some information.  You were involved in this excercise from the beginning. What exactly happened here?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I'm sorry.  I was captured along with President Baker right after the terrorist attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That's okay.  But what is this place?  I don't think it is just a nuclear wepaons disposal facility..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Boy oh boy... it's just like them!  Nobody told you anything, did they?  Okay... you see, this place isn't really for disposing nuclear weapons.  This base is owned and operated by a dummy corporation of ArmsTech."},{"character":"Snake","line":"This is a civilian base?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Right.  For the development of Metal Gear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel!"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"FOX-HOUND and the Next-Generation Special Forces were called here for the test launching of a dummy nuclear warhead."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why FOX-HOUND?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Because they're a Special Ops group used to handling top secret missions.  They figured they could keep it all hush-hush."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But we must have fired nuclear warheads before.  Why just this time?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I heard it was because this was to be a final test before the formal adoption of the Metal Gear program... that's what I heard anyway."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Hmmm... sounds kind of fishy...  So what do you think the terrorists want?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Sorry, I'm not sure.  I was captured with President Baker right after the revolt started."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh yeah, that's when he gave you the detonation override keys, right?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"That's right."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Amazing you were able to keep 'em hidden from the guards."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Well... women have more hiding places than men.  Anyway, you met up with Baker, huh?  How's he holding up?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"He's dead..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"What!?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Heart attack.  Same as the DARPA Chief."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"The Chief died from a heart attck too?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah, was either of them sick or anything?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"No, not that I heard of."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well, I don't believe in coincidences.  Something funny's going on."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Hmmm.  Sounds like it. But I have no idea what."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Me neither... yet.  Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You mean Dr. emmerich?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yes.  Is he still alive?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Probably.  he should be in the second floor basemant of the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building to the north."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Second floor basement?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Yeah, that's where his lab is.  I think they're forcing him to work on the nuclear launching program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Then we'd better do something before he finishes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're right.  In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You plan to take that thing on by yourself, Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It won't be the first time..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"........."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the best way to get to the building where the Doctor is being held?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"There's a cargo door on the first floor of this building that leads to the north."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the security level of the door there?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Five, but it's okay... I've got a level five card."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well, I've got to go save the Doctor.  You should go..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I'm going with you!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No way!  You're still too green.

Good luck doesn't last forever!"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I don't know what happened.  I just couldn't pull the trigger right away.  I never had any problems in training...

You wanna quit?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I can't quit.  I can't alow myself to quit now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Listen, Meryl.  Everybody feels sick the first time they kill someone.  Unfortunately, killing is one of those things that gets easier the more you do it.  In a war, all of mankind's worst emotions, worst traits come out. It's easy to forget what a sin is in the middle of a battlefield."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"But this isn't a war.  It's a terrorist action."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're just a little jumpy from the combat high.  The adrenaline in your blood is starting to whin out.

For now, just think about keeping yourself alive."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"If I get out of here alive, I'll think about that other stuff."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, let me try to say this another way... Stay the hell out of my way."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You're a real bastard, just like my uncle said."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Ha ha, I told you.  The real me is no match for the legend."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"It looks like you were right.  Okay Snake, I'll be a good girl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We'll link up after I grab the Doctor.  Then we'll take care of the detonation code override."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Got ya.

So far we've discovered about sixty of the so-called \"soldier genes.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"So his body was recovered after all."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and his cells have remained frozen in cryo-chamber. His genomic information is a priceless treasure to mankind."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Priceless to the military perhaps."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"His body was burned severely, but it was possible to restore his DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) profile from just a single strand of his hair."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You people are amazing. And then you're going to transplant those genes into soldiers?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. We'll use a process that I discovered called gene targeting. The strongest soldiers don't become what they are by acquiring their skills through training or experience, we now know that hereditary factors are far more crucial for creating superior soldiers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, we can't give them his body. It's potentially more dangerous than all the warheads on that island put together."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I hear the terrorists are calling themselves the \"Sons of Big Boss.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the time limit?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"24 hours. They say they'll launch after 24 hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did they say what the target will be?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"So far they haven't mentioned a target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"When did the countdown start?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"5 hours ago."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, who are you speaking for?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Naturally, I'm representing the US government."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So who's in supervisory control of this operation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The President of the United States."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Which means that the President must be meeting with his top aides in the map room about now, huh?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No at this point they're still video conferencing with each other."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If that's a real nuclear warhead, shouldn't they issue a COG (Continuity of Government)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Not yet. The Secretary of Defense has operational control and is fully aware of the situation. After you infiltrate, if you determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities a COG will be issued."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well if they haven't relocated to nuclear shelter under Mount Washingtion, I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet. Is the National Security Agency in on this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. So is the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The DIA? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They'll be sending us some support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We don't need desk jockies. We need a nuclear weapons specialist."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Of course. A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned to us."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We need backup from a specialist. I'm just an amateur when it comes to nuclear weapons."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I know. That's why I've requested the assistance of a military analyst named Nastasha Romanenko. She'll be providing you backup by Codec."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female analyst?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's built up an impressive record as an advisor to the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Contact her if you have any questions. She's also an expert on hi-tech weapons."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where's she working from?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"At her home in Los Angeles."},{"character":"Snake","line":"California. Seems like a million miles away."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How well-armed are these terrorists? I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They're heavily armed I'm afraid."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about they're battle experience."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The six members of FOX-HOUND in charge are all hardened veterans. They're tough enough to eat nails and ask for seconds."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The others are Next-Generation Special Forces. They're not your average grunts either."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They started out as an anti-terrorist special-ops unit made up of members from former biochem units, technical escort units, and the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Their purpose was to respond to threats involving next-generation weapons of mass destruction, including NBC (nuclear/biological/chemica) weapons."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Until \"they\" were added that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's \"they\"?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"These guys didn't start out as regular army."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a pretty international group. Mercenaries?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yeah. And it gets worse. Most of them were from a merc agency that I think you're familiar with. They were part of Big Boss' private guard. And after Big Boss went down, the military just bought out all their contracts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Outer Heaven."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"After that they were merged with our own VR unit, Force 21, and re-trained. If you ask me, these so-called \"Next-Generation Special Forces\" should to be called \"simulated soldiers.\" They have no real battle experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Video game players, huh?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy. They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers. Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by international law."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes, but those are just declarations not actual treaties."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit conspired in this attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"They're calling it a revolution."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Since they all went through the same gene therapy, they probably felt closer than brothers. They see the unit as their only family."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss. But if they were regular army, they must've been interviewed periodically by army counsellers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"According to their files, they all got straight A's on their psychological tests. They all seemed like fine, upstanding patriotic soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But they all took part in the uprising?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No. Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise. That's why there was a resupply of troops."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Apparently they consulted classified information about the soldier genes and performed their own gene therapy experiments."},{"character":"Snake","line":"They can do that even without you?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well our gene therapy process is almost completely automated. And besides that they're all geniuses with IQs over 180."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Even the existence of this genome army is a national secret of the highest order. We'd been hoping to investigate this quietly and deal with it behind closed doors."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Hi-Tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND. Your former unit, and one that I was a commander of. An elite group combining firepower and expertise. They're every bit as good as when I was commanding them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they're still around."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are six members of FOX-HOUND involved in this terrorist activity. Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities. Sniper Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter. Decoy Octopus, master of disguise. Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman. And Revolver Ocelot, specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a lovely bunch of folks. Too bad we'll be meeting under these circumstances."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"And finally, in charge of them, FOX-HOUND's squad leader Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake?!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes and you're the only person who can stand against him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Liquid Snake. The man with the same codename as you."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me what you know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager, the youngest person in the SAS (British Special Air Service).  His job was to track down and destroy mobile SCUD missile launching platforms. You were there too I believe. Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was just a kid myself back then."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The details are classified, but it seems that originally he penetrated the the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS."},{"character":"Snake","line":"He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But he never once showed his face in Century House. He was taken prisoner in Iraq, and after that there was no trace of him for several years. After you retired, he was rescued and became a member of FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using codenames."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know his real name. That information is so highly classified that even I can't look at it. Here's a photo of him.  Pretty shocking, huh?  His skin tone is a little different but otherwise you two are exact duplicates."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have a twin?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know the details, but it seems so. That's why we really need you for this mission."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're the only one who can beat him. Now that I've met you, I know. You've got something he doesn't. I can see it in your eyes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why don't I find that thought more comforting?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore. Let me go back to Twin Lakes."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Why Snake? Is your life in Alaska all that great?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's a dogsled race this week. Next Saturday I have to be in Anchorage."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The Iditarod? The longest sled race in the world? When did you become a dog musher?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Right now my fifty huskies are my only family. I've got to take care of them."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry about your dogs."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you mean?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry Snake but this vessel is headed for the Bering Sea. There's no room for debate."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I told you, even if I do owe you I don't anything to this army or this country!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You will accept this assignment!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why should I be stupid enough to do that? I'm no patriot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, there's enough dirt in your file from your days as an agent to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh I see. Blackmail."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No Snake. I prefer to look at it as helping you to come to a decision more easily. But anyway, I know you better than that. You'd take this assignment even without the threat."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why do you say that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You're a natural born soldier. You're not the grow old gracefully type. Same for all of us who've seen real action. The only place we can feel truly alive is on the battlefield. I'm a solider too. I know those feelings of powerlessness, frustration that you feel everyday. You've tried to play the boy scout out there in Alaska, but you can't race dogs in the snow forever.  Why don't you come back to us and be a soldier again."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You think my life is some kind of joke?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I just want to give you back your purpose in life."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're retired. Why are you involved in this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because there aren't many people who know FOX-HOUND as well as I do."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Is that really the only reason?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've been soldiering for a long time, I don't know anything else. I guess even though I'm getting a little old, I still love to be in the field."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're a lousy liar. Tell me the real reason."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Okay Snake. Sorry. I'll be frank. A person very dear to me is being held hostage."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who is it?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"My niece. Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What was your niece doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt. And my niece was one of those called in as an emergency replacement."},{"character":"Snake","line":"She looks like you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's my little brother's girl. He died in the Gulf War. Since then I've been watching after her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A personal motive, Colonel. That's not very soldierly."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm retired. I'm just an old man now. And I'm your friend."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Since when are we friends?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've thought of us as friends since the fall of Zanzibar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"With my personality I don't have too many friends."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's what I trust about you. It's what makes you human. Please Snake. Save my niece Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"All right, but I have two conditions."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Name them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One, no more secrets between us. I want complete disclosure at all times and two, I'll only accept orders from you, Colonel. No cutoffs involved okay?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Agreed. That's why I was called. But one thing."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not a colonel anymore. Just a retired old warhorse."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, Colonel."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That doctor. Is she part of this operation too?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She was in charge of FOX-HOUND's gene therapy. She knows more about those men than anyone else."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean you've seen them naked?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Make no mistake. I'm not a nurse. I'm a scientist."},{"character":"Snake","line":"By the way, what was that injection for?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It's a combination of and nanomachines and an anti-freezing peptide so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze, even at sub-arctic temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nanomachines?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Not just one kind either. There are different types which will replenish the supply of adrenaline, nutrition and sugar in your bloodstream."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Now I don't have to worry about food."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I also put some nootropics in there."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Say what?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Nootropics. It's a class of drugs which will help improve your mental functioning."},{"character":"Snake","line":"It'll make smarter huh? Anything else?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Benzedrine. It's a type of stimulant. It'll keep you alert and responsive for twelve straight hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That was quite a cocktail. Anything else in there?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Those nanomachines will also keep your Codec's batteries charged up."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're welcome."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I need to borrow your scissors."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"What are you going to do?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't worry. Just going to clean myself up a little."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Huh?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't want to be mistaken for the leader of the terrorists."},{"character":"action","line":""},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake swims through the lower dock of the disposal facility.  We see a man riding up the cargo elevator.)"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Stay alert!  He'll be through here, I know it.  I'm going to go swat down a couple of bothersome flies."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake removes his flippers and calls Campbell on the codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"This is Snake.  Colonel, can you hear me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Loud and clear Snake.  What's the situation?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Just as I expected.  You'll have to take the elevator to the surface.  But make sure that nobody sees you.  If you need to contact me by codec, the frequency is 140.85.  When you want to use the codec push the Select button. When we need to contact you the codec will beep.  When you hear that noise push the Select button. The codec directly stimulates the small bones of your ear, no one but you will be able to hear it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Got it, okay, I'm ready to go."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake takes off his scuba gear and watches the landscape slide by as the elevator ascends.  The title appears on the screen \"Metal Gear Solid\".  The elevator stops and Snake quickly runs out and looks for cover behind a storage crate.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It's Snake.  I'm in front of the disposal facility."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Excellent, Snake.  Age hasn't slowed you down one bit."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How's that Sneaking Suit working out?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm nice and dry, but it is a little hard to move."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Bear with it.  It's designed to prevent hypothermia.  This is Alaska you know."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Take it easy, I'm grateful.  If it wasn't for your suit and your shot I would have turned into a popsicle out there."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"An anti-freezing peptide Snake.  All of the Genome soldiers in this exercise are using it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm relieved to hear that.  Already tested, huh?  By the way, how's the diversionary operation going?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.  The terrorist's radar should have picked them up by now."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake peers out from behind the crate and sees a group of terrorists by a helicopter.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"A Hind D?  Colonel, what's a Russian gunship doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I have no idea...but it looks like our little diversion got their attention.  Now's your best chance to slip in unnoticed."},{"character":"action","line":"(The helicopter takes off, throwing snow in all directions, the guards on the ground shield their eyes as they follow it up into the sky.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are only 18 hours left until their deadline.  You've got to hurry."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Wow...you must be crazy to fly a Hind in this kind of weather."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Oh sorry, I haven't introduced you two yet.  This is Mei Ling.  She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist. She designed your codec, as well as your Soliton radar system. Contact her if you have any questions about either of them."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Nice to meet you Snake.  It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"What's wrong?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nothing...I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so...cute."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"You're just flattering me..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, I'm serious.  Now I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"C'mon, I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake... But I'm surprised, you're very frank for a trained killer."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting the man behind the legend...but first, let me explain about your Soliton radar system."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"The bright dot in the middle is you Snake.  The red dots are your enemies and the blue cone shape represents their field of vision."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Be careful Snake. The Genome soldiers have highly developed senses of hearing and vision due to their gene therapy.  Make sure you don't let them see you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"First I want you to infiltrate the disposal site and look for the DARPA Chief."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The DARPA Chief was injected with the same GPS transmitting nanomachines as you."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"He should appear on your radar as a green dot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Get whatever information you can from him about the terrorists.  If he's alive that is..."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Snake, your radar isn't affected by the weather, but if you're discovered by an enemy you won't be able to use it."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, it gets jammed easily I'm afraid."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Yes, it's all made from currently existing technology.  You won't be able to use it in an area with strong harmonic resonance.  So be careful."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll be monitoring your movements by radar... so contact us by Codec anytime  you want."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Got it.  I'll call if I'm feeling lonely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Seriously Snake.  We're here to back you up, so call if you need some information or advice."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"I'm also in charge of your mission data.  Contact me if you want me to record your current status.  My frequency is 140.96.  It's a dedicated frequency for saving data.  Don't forget it."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Remember, except for your binoculars you're naked.  You need to arm yourself with whatever weapons you can find."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember.  First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here, and then all my weapons are taken away.  Imagine yourself put in that position."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well, if yck in one you make it back in one piece, maybe I'll let you do a strip search on me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll hold you to that doctor.  By the way, sorry to dissapoint you but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How did you do that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"In my stomach.  Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach acids."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Cigarettes?  How are those going to help you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You never know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"If you want to get in, there's the front door."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake pulls out his binoculars and takes a look.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"It's the fastest way, but there's too much risk of being spotted by the enemy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't just knock on the door and ask them to let me in.

Baker knows one and I know one."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Baker?  The president of ArmsTech?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"That's right.

You... you're from the Pentagon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Answer my question!  What about your code!?  There's no time!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I... talked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What! Now the terrorists have both codes and can launch anytime!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"It's not like I didn't fight.

How'd you do it?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Surgical implants in my brain."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Surgical implants?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Kind of like a psychic insulation.

He had a heart attack or something."},{"character":"Baker","line":"A heart attack? Oh, don't be a fool."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Anyway, the terrorists have both codes now."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Those boys are totally insane.  They wouldn't hesitate to launch."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I agree.  But what do they really want?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Who knows.  Maybe they're like us in the arms industry... always looking forward to the next good war."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well I'm not going to let these maniacs start a war toady.  Do you still have the card keys."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Card keys?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"To override tge detonation codes!  I heard you had them..."},{"character":"Baker","line":"No, not anymore."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What!?  Who does then!?  Not the terrorists!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"No, that woman."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Woman!?  Who!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"A soldier that was thrown in prison along with me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female soldier?  It must be..."},{"character":"Baker","line":"She said that she had just joined up as a new recruit.  She said they threw her in prison because she refused to take part in the rebellion."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A new recruit?  Could that be the Colonel's niece!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I gave her the key.  Looks like she managed to break out of here though. I hope she's okay."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sure she is.  She's green... but as tough as they come.  But how did you know she escaped?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I was in contact with her by Codec.  Until I was tied up here that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Codec?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  She stole it from the guard.  If she still has it, you should be able to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sure she still has it.  What frequency was she at?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh yeah.  Let me tell you.  It's..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker is struggling to remember.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Huh?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...Oh... sorry... I forgot..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh that's right!  It should be on the back of the CD case.  Try to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll contact her right away.  But tell me... If this doesn't work, is there some other way to prevent the missile launch?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Hmmm.  You need to find Hal Emmerich, one of my employees."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The team leader of the Metal Gear Rex project.  A genius at engineering, but a little bit of an oddball.  If there is anyone who can figure out how to stop Metal Gear from launching, it's him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What if he can't come up with anything?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You'll have to destroy it.  Emmerich knows how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where is this Emmerich?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Well... he's probably being held somewhere in the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building.  It's north from here.  That's where he worked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, but... why Metal Gear?  The Nuclear Age ended with the turn of the millenium."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You're wrong.  The threat of nuclear war isn't gone... in fact it's greater than it's ever been."},{"character":"action","line":"(Scenes of missile launches, storage buildings, and missile silos are shown.)"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The amount of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium is increasing even today.  Listen, have you ever seen a warehouse full of nuclear material?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...No."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Drums and drums of nuclear waste stacked this high.  As far as you can see because there's still no real way to dispose of the stuff."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they just close the lid and pretend like it'll go away?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Essentially, yes.  And they're not even doing a good job of storing it.  Many of the drums are corroded... with nuclear waste seeping out of them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Unbelievable."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Not only that, several pounds of MUF are reported every year."},{"character":"Snake","line":"MUF?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"It stands for \"material unnacounted for\". It proves that there is a large and well organized black market in nuclear materials. Furthermore, since the end of the Cold War, Russian nuclear engineers, in particular, are out of work with nowhere to turn."},{"character":"action","line":"(We go back to the chamber where Snake and Baker are conversing.)"},{"character":"Baker","line":"In other words, there is plenty of nuclear material and scientists for making a bomb.  We live in an age when any small country can have a nuclear weapons program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about the other superpowers?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Russia and China still maintain a signifigant nuclear presence. Complete nuclear disarmament is an impossibility.  To maintain our own policy of deterrance, we need a weapon of overwhelming power."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean Metal Gear."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You know our industry suffered quite a blow as a result of the cut-backs in military budgets, due to this so called \"peace\"."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember hearing a lot about mergers and take-overs among the big weapons makers."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  And after my company lost their bid to produce the Air Force's next fighter jet, the Metal Gear project was out last ace in the hole.  That's why we pushed to have Metal Gear developed as a black project."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Black project?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Secret projects paid for by the Pentagon's black budget.  You can avoid a lot of red tape a get a great lead-time on your weapons production.  And no one can bother you.  Not even those bleeding heart liberals on the military oversight committee."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Bribes."},{"character":"Baker","line":"I prefer to think of it as good buisness.  Anyway, Metal Gear was going to be formally adopted after the results of this exercise were analyzed."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't give a crap about you and your company."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes, that's about what I'd expect from a grunt like you... Here, this is what you came for, right?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker fishes a disc out of his pocket and hands it to Snake.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"An optical disk.  It's all here.  The main hard drive was destroyed by gunfire.  This is the only remaining copy of the data."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What kind of data?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"All the data collected from this exercise.  Don't play dumb.  I know you were sent to get this.  I hid it from that sadistic maniac while he was torturing me.  They don't know that this disk exists. Make sure that you report this to Jim... to your boss.  I'll give you my card too.  It'll open up all level two security doors."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Can you walk?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...No ...You go on without me.  They got my password... they don't want anything else from me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have one more question.  Who or what was that ninja thing?  It looked like you knew something."},{"character":"Baker","line":"That ninja?  That was FOX-HOUND's dark little secret."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Dark little secret?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"An experimantal... genome... soldier..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker coughs once more.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You know him?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You should ask Dr. Naomi Hunter from FOX-HOUND.  She knows better than I."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You've got to stop them.  If it goes public, my company and I are... finished."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?  Doesn't Metal Gear use currently existing technology?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Metal Gear itself does, but..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker bends over in pain.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Huh!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"What... what did you do to me!?  Uh... oooh...no!  ...Ooh.  Oh no, it can't be! ...those Pentagon bastards!  ...So they...they actually went ahead and did it!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"They... they're just... using you for... uuuhhh..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker slumps over and Snake stands in front of him stunned and confused.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What the hell?"},{"character":"action","line":"(After thinking for a moment he calls Campbell on the Codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel!

Why just this time?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I heard it was because this was to be a final test before the formal adoption of the Metal Gear program... that's what I heard anyway."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Hmmm... sounds kind of fishy...  So what do you think the terrorists want?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Sorry, I'm not sure.  I was captured with President Baker right after the revolt started."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh yeah, that's when he gave you the detonation override keys, right?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"That's right."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Amazing you were able to keep 'em hidden from the guards."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Well... women have more hiding places than men.  Anyway, you met up with Baker, huh?  How's he holding up?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"He's dead..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"What!?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Heart attack.  Same as the DARPA Chief."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"The Chief died from a heart attck too?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah, was either of them sick or anything?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"No, not that I heard of."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well, I don't believe in coincidences.  Something funny's going on."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Hmmm.  Sounds like it. But I have no idea what."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Me neither... yet.  Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You mean Dr. emmerich?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yes.  Is he still alive?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Probably.  he should be in the second floor basemant of the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building to the north."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Second floor basement?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Yeah, that's where his lab is.  I think they're forcing him to work on the nuclear launching program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Then we'd better do something before he finishes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're right.  In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You plan to take that thing on by yourself, Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It won't be the first time..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"........."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the best way to get to the building where the Doctor is being held?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"There's a cargo door on the first floor of this building that leads to the north."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the security level of the door there?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Five, but it's okay...

You wanna quit?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I can't quit.  I can't alow myself to quit now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Listen, Meryl.  Everybody feels sick the first time they kill someone.  Unfortunately, killing is one of those things that gets easier the more you do it.  In a war, all of mankind's worst emotions, worst traits come out.

Okay Snake, I'll be a good girl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We'll link up after I grab the Doctor.  Then we'll take care of the detonation code override."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Got ya.

You said you'd stay put and be a good girl!"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I changed my mind."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't get careless.

I always knew that one day I would meet you. The man who stole what was rightly mine... the man who stole my birthright.  Me? I'm the man you stole everything good from.

They're all hypocrites, every one of them."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Is that your opinion as a Kurd?"},{"character":"Wolf","line":"They always put politics first."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"That's right.

Normally the Americans are the first ones to the negotiating table.  They must think they've go something up their sleeves."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"So it's come down to it, has it.

I didn't think a pencil pusher like him would be so tough."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Well... his mental defenses were reinforced by hypnotherapy."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Boss, what about that ninja?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"He killed 12 men.  Whoever he is, he's some kind of lunatic."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Bastard took my hand... How could he have gotten in here?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Perhaps there's a spy among us...

I'm about to show you some of its nicer features..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where are my things?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Oh don't worry.  They're all there.  Washington was taking quite a chance sending you here.  Someone must have had a lot of faith in your skill.

Metal Gear... secret advanced nuclear weapons research...  Does the White House know about this?  How deep does it go?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"As far as I know, as of yesterday, the President had not  been briefed about the Rex Project."},{"character":"Snake","line":"\"Need to know basis\", is that the idea?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"These are sensitive times.  Even sub-critical nuclear tests are causing quite a stir."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Plausible deniability, huh?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes.  And tomorrow the President and his Russian counterpart are scheduled to sign the Start 3 Accord."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I get it.  That's the reason for the deadline."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right, Snake.  And that's why we can't let the terrorist attack go public."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We still haven't even ratified Start 2 or dealt with the issue of TMDs.  This has to do with the Presodent's reputation and America's place as the dominant superpower."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So patriotism is your excuse for circumventing the Constitution?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Please, Snake... just stop them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why should I?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because you're the only one who can."},{"character":"Snake","line":"In that case, tell me the truth about this new type of nuclear warhead."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I told you before.  I don't knwo the details."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't believe you.If the situation is so serious, why don't you give in to their demands?  Let them have Big Boss's remains."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You see..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Or is there some reason that you can't do that?  Something you haven't told me about?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Publicly, the President has been very vocal in his opposition to eugenics experiments.

The hell with you!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The corpse of the DARPA Chief is lying right here next to me."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Poor man."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But it's strange.

All his blood's been drained out too."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Drained!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Maybe to slow down decomposition?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have no idea."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"But the Chief only died a few hours ago, right?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Right.  But he's already started to decompose."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"What could it all be about?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"SOmething in his blood that they wanted?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I doubt it.  Just the nanomachines and the transmitter."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Did the Chief tell them his detonation code?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm afraid so.  It looks like they've got both codes and are nearly ready to launch."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Damn.  Is there any way to prevent it?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It seems there's some type of emergency override device that can cancel out the detonation code.  It's a countermeasure that ArmsTech installed secretly.  You have to unlock it with three special card keys."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"And where are those keys?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I've got one of them.  I don't know where the other two are. Besides, I'm locked up here."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We've got no choice.  Forget about the keys.  Your top priority now is to destroy Metal Gear itself.  Sorry to lay it all in your lap, but you're all I've got.  Bust out of there and get to the Communications Tower."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"......."},{"character":"Snake","line":".......  Naomi, please talk to me.

That's a tough one..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Any family?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's not a very happy topic for me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't have any family.

By my own hand."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Big Boss."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"What!? Big Boss!?  I had no idea."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There was no way you could.  It happened in Zanzibar 6 years ago. Only Snake and I know the real truth of what happened there."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"So, is it true?  Was Big Boss really your father?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"That's what he said.  That's all I know."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And you were able to kill him, knowing that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yup."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"He wanted it.  Besides, some people just need killing..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's patricide."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yup.  That's the trauma that Mantis was talking about.  The one we share in common."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Is that why you left FOX-HOUND?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Let's just say that I needed to be alone for a while and Alaska was the perfect place..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...Snake... I didn't have a real family either.  Just a big brother who put me through school.  We weren't even blood-related and he was much older than me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where is he?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"He's dead..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sorry."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...Snake, is there a woman in your life?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"After you've been through as many wars as me, it's hard to trust anyone."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Friends?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Roy Campbell..."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Huh?  You're still calling me friend?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Is that it?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, there was another... Frank Jaeger."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"What!?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Big Boss's most trusted lietenant and the only member of FOX-HOUND to ever recieve the codename \"Fox\".  Gray Fox."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"........"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I learned a lot from him."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"But... didn't you try to kill each other?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"That's true.  We did.  In Zanzibar.  But it was nothing personal. We were just proffesionals on opposite sides, that's all."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And you still call yourselves friends?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Hard to believe?  War is no reason to end a friendship."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's insane."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I first met him on the battlefield.  He was being held a prisoner of Outer Heaven.  But he didn't look like a prisoner to me.  He was always so cool and precise.  I was still green and he showed me the ropes."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You knew him well?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No.  We never talked about our personal lives.  Sort of an unwritten rule.  The nest time I saw him on the battlefield, we were enemies.  We were fighting barehanded in a minefield.  I know it sounds strange to most people.  But we were just two soldiers doing our jobs.  It's like a sport."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Men and their games!  You're like wild animals!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're right.  We are animals."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"So if you were friends, then how do you explain the Ninja's behavior?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't know."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It's your genes... they make you predisposed towards violence!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You really like talking about genes, Naomi.  Why did you get into genetic research anyway?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I never knew who my parents were or even what they looked like. I guess I got into genetics because I wanted to figure out why I'm the way I am."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So you studied about DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yeah.  I thought if I studied my genetic structure, I'd find out who I really was.  I thought that by analyzing a person's genetic information, I could retrieve the blank spots in that person's memory."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Memory is stored in DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"We're not sure.  But we know that a person's genetic fate is determined just by the sequence of the four bases in their DNA."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So what about my fate? You know my DNA sequence, don't you?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Your fate?  I...I'm sorry.  I have no idea."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Of course not.

My grandfather was already dead by the time I learned about him.  I never even had the chance to meet him."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Oh..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Snake, good luck."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Watch your back, Snake."}]},{"title":"\"I'm your shadow!\"","dialog":[{"character":"Campbell","line":"It's been a long time Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I should've known you were behind this, Colonel."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's no way to greet an old war buddy Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you want from me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I just invited you here so we could have a talk."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Invited!? That's what you call sending armed soldiers after me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Sorry if they were a little rough with you. But we've got a serious situation here. Only you can get us out of it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm retired from FOX-HOUND. You're not my commander anymore, and I don't have to take orders from you or anyone else."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You will take these orders. I know it."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Excuse me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Dr. Naomi Hunter. She's chief of FOX-HOUND's medical staff and an expert in gene therapy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Are you military?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"No, civilian. I've been sent here from ATGC. Pleasure to meet you"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Don't worry this injection won't hurt a bit."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the shot for?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"What's wrong? You don't like shots?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake listen up. It all went down five hours ago. Heavily armed soliders occupied Shadow Moses Island, a remote island off the coast of Alaska."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What soldiers?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Next-Generation Special Forces led by members of unit FOX-HOUND. They've presented Washington with a single demand, and they say that if it isn't met, they'll launch a nuclear weapon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A nuclear weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. You see, the island is the site of a secret nuclear weapons disposal facility."},{"character":"Snake","line":"FOX-HOUND hijacking a nuclear weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Now you understand how serious the situation is. You'll have two mission objectives. First, you're to rescue the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Chief, Donald Anderson, and the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker. They're both being held as hostages."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Those are some heavy duty hostages."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Secondly, you're to investigate whether or not the terrorists have the ability to launch a nuclear strike, and stop them if they do. Any questions, Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Questions? I haven't even said whether I'd accept this mission."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well you can make up your mind after you hear more about the situation."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about the nuclear weapons disposal facility."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The disposal facility includes a hardened underground base. Even with our most advanced intelligence gathering equipment, we can't tell what's happening inside."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So someone needs to penetrate, gather intelligence, and report back... Sounds like a spy movie. What's the insertion method?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well an air insertion is impossible."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Not with this storm going on."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll approach the disposal facility by sub."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Approach?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, within a few miles of it. The facility is equipped with sonar detection capability. They'd be able to hear our engine or propeller noise."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And then?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll launch a one-man SDV (swimmer delivery vehicle)."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Launch?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Same as a torpedo. Only this has no propulsion device of its own. After the SDV gets as close as it can, dispose of it. From there on you'll have to swim."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You want me to swim in sub-zero Alaskan water?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry. That suit represents the latest advances in poly- thermal technology. The nuclear weapons disposal facility covers the whole island. I'll contact you by Codec after you reach your target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Anyone going with me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"As usual, this is a one-man inflitration mission."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Weapons and equipment OSP (on-site procurement)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. This a top-secret black op. Don't expect any official support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Chief of DARPA and the president of an arms manufacturing company... what business did they have at a nuclear weapons disposal facility?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The truth is that secret exercises were being conducted at the time the terrorist group attacked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Must be extremely important exercises if those two were directly involved. Were they testing some kind of new advanced weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not privy to that information."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do we know exactly where they're being held?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The DARPA chief has also been injected with a mini-transmitter. As you get closer you should be able to pick up his location on your radar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do they really have the ability to launch a nuclear missile?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They say they do. They even gave us the serial number of the warhead they plan to use."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was the number confirmed?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. At the very least, they've got their hands on a real nuclear warhead."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Isn't there some kind of safety device to prevent this kind of terrorism?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. Every missile and warhead in our arsenal is equipped with a PAL, which uses a discreet detonation code."},{"character":"Snake","line":"PAL?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Permissive Action Link. A safety control system built into all nuclear weapons systems. But even so, we can't rest easy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why not?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because the DARPA Chief knows the detonation code."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But even if they have a nuclear warhead, it must've been removed from its missile. All the missiles on these disposal sites are supposed to be dismantled. It's not that easy to get your hands on an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missle)."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That used to be true, but since the end of the Cold War you can get anything if you have enough money and the right connections."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So what exactly are they demanding?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"A person's remains."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Remains?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's right. To be more accurate, cell specimens which contain the individual's genomic information."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Cell specimens? Why would they want that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The terrorists need them. You see these Next-Generation Special Forces have been strengthened through gene therapy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Strengthened?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You've heard of the Human Genome Project. They've been mapping the human genome, and they're nearly finished. Following up on this research, the military has been working towards identifiying those genes which are responsible for making effective soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There are genes that do that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and using gene therapy they're able to transplant those genes into regular soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Gene therapy?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I'll explain this part. With gene therapy, we can remove those genes which we know may lead to sickness or disease, and that the same time, splice in genes with beneficial effects such as resistance to cancer for example."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"In other words, we can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases and at the same time add genetic characteristics as desired."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, and so if you knew what genes were responsible for making the perfect soldier, you could implant them in the same way, right?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes we could."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But it all depends on being able to isolate and identify those \"soldier genes\"."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And in order to do that, it's helpful to study the genomic information of one of the greatest soldiers ever."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One of the greatest soldiers ever?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The man they call the greatest warrior of the twentieth century."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You don't mean Big Boss?!"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right. We've been working feverishly to identify the genes responsible for his incredible combat skill. So far we've discovered about sixty of the so-called \"soldier genes.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"So his body was recovered after all."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and his cells have remained frozen in cryo-chamber. His genomic information is a priceless treasure to mankind."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Priceless to the military perhaps."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"His body was burned severely, but it was possible to restore his DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) profile from just a single strand of his hair."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You people are amazing. And then you're going to transplant those genes into soldiers?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. We'll use a process that I discovered called gene targeting. The strongest soldiers don't become what they are by acquiring their skills through training or experience, we now know that hereditary factors are far more crucial for creating superior soldiers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, we can't give them his body. It's potentially more dangerous than all the warheads on that island put together."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I hear the terrorists are calling themselves the \"Sons of Big Boss.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the time limit?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"24 hours. They say they'll launch after 24 hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did they say what the target will be?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"So far they haven't mentioned a target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"When did the countdown start?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"5 hours ago."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, who are you speaking for?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Naturally, I'm representing the US government."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So who's in supervisory control of this operation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The President of the United States."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Which means that the President must be meeting with his top aides in the map room about now, huh?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No at this point they're still video conferencing with each other."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If that's a real nuclear warhead, shouldn't they issue a COG (Continuity of Government)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Not yet. The Secretary of Defense has operational control and is fully aware of the situation. After you infiltrate, if you determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities a COG will be issued."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well if they haven't relocated to nuclear shelter under Mount Washingtion, I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet. Is the National Security Agency in on this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. So is the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The DIA? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They'll be sending us some support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We don't need desk jockies. We need a nuclear weapons specialist."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Of course. A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned to us."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We need backup from a specialist. I'm just an amateur when it comes to nuclear weapons."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I know. That's why I've requested the assistance of a military analyst named Nastasha Romanenko. She'll be providing you backup by Codec."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female analyst?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's built up an impressive record as an advisor to the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Contact her if you have any questions. She's also an expert on hi-tech weapons."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where's she working from?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"At her home in Los Angeles."},{"character":"Snake","line":"California. Seems like a million miles away."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How well-armed are these terrorists? I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They're heavily armed I'm afraid."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about they're battle experience."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The six members of FOX-HOUND in charge are all hardened veterans. They're tough enough to eat nails and ask for seconds."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The others are Next-Generation Special Forces. They're not your average grunts either."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They started out as an anti-terrorist special-ops unit made up of members from former biochem units, technical escort units, and the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Their purpose was to respond to threats involving next-generation weapons of mass destruction, including NBC (nuclear/biological/chemica) weapons."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Until \"they\" were added that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's \"they\"?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"These guys didn't start out as regular army."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a pretty international group. Mercenaries?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yeah. And it gets worse. Most of them were from a merc agency that I think you're familiar with. They were part of Big Boss' private guard. And after Big Boss went down, the military just bought out all their contracts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Outer Heaven."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"After that they were merged with our own VR unit, Force 21, and re-trained. If you ask me, these so-called \"Next-Generation Special Forces\" should to be called \"simulated soldiers.\" They have no real battle experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Video game players, huh?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy. They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers. Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by international law."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes, but those are just declarations not actual treaties."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit conspired in this attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"They're calling it a revolution."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Since they all went through the same gene therapy, they probably felt closer than brothers. They see the unit as their only family."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss. But if they were regular army, they must've been interviewed periodically by army counsellers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"According to their files, they all got straight A's on their psychological tests. They all seemed like fine, upstanding patriotic soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But they all took part in the uprising?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No. Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise. That's why there was a resupply of troops."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Apparently they consulted classified information about the soldier genes and performed their own gene therapy experiments."},{"character":"Snake","line":"They can do that even without you?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well our gene therapy process is almost completely automated. And besides that they're all geniuses with IQs over 180."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Even the existence of this genome army is a national secret of the highest order. We'd been hoping to investigate this quietly and deal with it behind closed doors."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Hi-Tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND. Your former unit, and one that I was a commander of. An elite group combining firepower and expertise. They're every bit as good as when I was commanding them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they're still around."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are six members of FOX-HOUND involved in this terrorist activity. Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities. Sniper Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter. Decoy Octopus, master of disguise. Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman. And Revolver Ocelot, specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a lovely bunch of folks. Too bad we'll be meeting under these circumstances."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"And finally, in charge of them, FOX-HOUND's squad leader Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake?!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes and you're the only person who can stand against him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Liquid Snake. The man with the same codename as you."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me what you know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager, the youngest person in the SAS (British Special Air Service).  His job was to track down and destroy mobile SCUD missile launching platforms. You were there too I believe. Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was just a kid myself back then."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The details are classified, but it seems that originally he penetrated the the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS."},{"character":"Snake","line":"He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But he never once showed his face in Century House. He was taken prisoner in Iraq, and after that there was no trace of him for several years. After you retired, he was rescued and became a member of FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using codenames."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know his real name. That information is so highly classified that even I can't look at it. Here's a photo of him.  Pretty shocking, huh?  His skin tone is a little different but otherwise you two are exact duplicates."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have a twin?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know the details, but it seems so. That's why we really need you for this mission."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're the only one who can beat him. Now that I've met you, I know. You've got something he doesn't. I can see it in your eyes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why don't I find that thought more comforting?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore. Let me go back to Twin Lakes."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Why Snake? Is your life in Alaska all that great?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's a dogsled race this week. Next Saturday I have to be in Anchorage."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The Iditarod? The longest sled race in the world? When did you become a dog musher?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Right now my fifty huskies are my only family. I've got to take care of them."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry about your dogs."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you mean?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry Snake but this vessel is headed for the Bering Sea. There's no room for debate."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I told you, even if I do owe you I don't anything to this army or this country!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You will accept this assignment!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why should I be stupid enough to do that? I'm no patriot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, there's enough dirt in your file from your days as an agent to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh I see. Blackmail."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No Snake. I prefer to look at it as helping you to come to a decision more easily. But anyway, I know you better than that. You'd take this assignment even without the threat."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why do you say that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You're a natural born soldier. You're not the grow old gracefully type. Same for all of us who've seen real action. The only place we can feel truly alive is on the battlefield. I'm a solider too. I know those feelings of powerlessness, frustration that you feel everyday. You've tried to play the boy scout out there in Alaska, but you can't race dogs in the snow forever.  Why don't you come back to us and be a soldier again."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You think my life is some kind of joke?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I just want to give you back your purpose in life."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're retired. Why are you involved in this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because there aren't many people who know FOX-HOUND as well as I do."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Is that really the only reason?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've been soldiering for a long time, I don't know anything else. I guess even though I'm getting a little old, I still love to be in the field."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're a lousy liar. Tell me the real reason."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Okay Snake. Sorry. I'll be frank. A person very dear to me is being held hostage."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who is it?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"My niece. Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What was your niece doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt. And my niece was one of those called in as an emergency replacement."},{"character":"Snake","line":"She looks like you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's my little brother's girl. He died in the Gulf War. Since then I've been watching after her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A personal motive, Colonel. That's not very soldierly."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm retired. I'm just an old man now. And I'm your friend."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Since when are we friends?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've thought of us as friends since the fall of Zanzibar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"With my personality I don't have too many friends."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's what I trust about you. It's what makes you human. Please Snake. Save my niece Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"All right, but I have two conditions."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Name them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One, no more secrets between us. I want complete disclosure at all times and two, I'll only accept orders from you, Colonel. No cutoffs involved okay?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Agreed. That's why I was called. But one thing."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not a colonel anymore. Just a retired old warhorse."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, Colonel."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That doctor. Is she part of this operation too?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She was in charge of FOX-HOUND's gene therapy. She knows more about those men than anyone else."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean you've seen them naked?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Make no mistake. I'm not a nurse. I'm a scientist."},{"character":"Snake","line":"By the way, what was that injection for?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It's a combination of and nanomachines and an anti-freezing peptide so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze, even at sub-arctic temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nanomachines?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Not just one kind either. There are different types which will replenish the supply of adrenaline, nutrition and sugar in your bloodstream."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Now I don't have to worry about food."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I also put some nootropics in there."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Say what?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Nootropics. It's a class of drugs which will help improve your mental functioning."},{"character":"Snake","line":"It'll make smarter huh? Anything else?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Benzedrine. It's a type of stimulant. It'll keep you alert and responsive for twelve straight hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That was quite a cocktail. Anything else in there?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Those nanomachines will also keep your Codec's batteries charged up."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're welcome."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I need to borrow your scissors."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"What are you going to do?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't worry. Just going to clean myself up a little."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Huh?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't want to be mistaken for the leader of the terrorists."},{"character":"action","line":""},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake swims through the lower dock of the disposal facility.  We see a man riding up the cargo elevator.)"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Stay alert!  He'll be through here, I know it.  I'm going to go swat down a couple of bothersome flies."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake removes his flippers and calls Campbell on the codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"This is Snake.  Colonel, can you hear me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Loud and clear Snake.  What's the situation?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Just as I expected.  You'll have to take the elevator to the surface.  But make sure that nobody sees you.  If you need to contact me by codec, the frequency is 140.85.  When you want to use the codec push the Select button. When we need to contact you the codec will beep.  When you hear that noise push the Select button. The codec directly stimulates the small bones of your ear, no one but you will be able to hear it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Got it, okay, I'm ready to go."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake takes off his scuba gear and watches the landscape slide by as the elevator ascends.

I'm in front of the disposal facility."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Excellent, Snake.  Age hasn't slowed you down one bit."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How's that Sneaking Suit working out?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm nice and dry, but it is a little hard to move."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Bear with it.  It's designed to prevent hypothermia.  This is Alaska you know."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Take it easy, I'm grateful.  If it wasn't for your suit and your shot I would have turned into a popsicle out there."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"An anti-freezing peptide Snake.  All of the Genome soldiers in this exercise are using it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm relieved to hear that.  Already tested, huh?  By the way, how's the diversionary operation going?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.  The terrorist's radar should have picked them up by now."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake peers out from behind the crate and sees a group of terrorists by a helicopter.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"A Hind D?  Colonel, what's a Russian gunship doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I have no idea...but it looks like our little diversion got their attention.  Now's your best chance to slip in unnoticed."},{"character":"action","line":"(The helicopter takes off, throwing snow in all directions, the guards on the ground shield their eyes as they follow it up into the sky.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are only 18 hours left until their deadline.  You've got to hurry."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Wow...you must be crazy to fly a Hind in this kind of weather."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Oh sorry, I haven't introduced you two yet.  This is Mei Ling.  She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist. She designed your codec, as well as your Soliton radar system. Contact her if you have any questions about either of them."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Nice to meet you Snake.  It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"What's wrong?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nothing...I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so...cute."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"You're just flattering me..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, I'm serious.  Now I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"C'mon, I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake...

I forgot..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh that's right!  It should be on the back of the CD case.  Try to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll contact her right away.  But tell me... If this doesn't work, is there some other way to prevent the missile launch?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Hmmm.  You need to find Hal Emmerich, one of my employees."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The team leader of the Metal Gear Rex project.

If there is anyone who can figure out how to stop Metal Gear from launching, it's him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What if he can't come up with anything?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You'll have to destroy it.  Emmerich knows how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where is this Emmerich?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Well... he's probably being held somewhere in the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building.

And after my company lost their bid to produce the Air Force's next fighter jet, the Metal Gear project was out last ace in the hole.  That's why we pushed to have Metal Gear developed as a black project."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Black project?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Secret projects paid for by the Pentagon's black budget.

You better hurry. If they were planning a launch from the start, then their ballistic program is probably finished.  And since they haven't called for me in a few hours, they must not need me.  In other words, they must be ready to launch."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Meryl's got the detonation override keys.

And that's why we can't let the terrorist attack go public."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We still haven't even ratified Start 2 or dealt with the issue of TMDs.

Is there any way to prevent it?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It seems there's some type of emergency override device that can cancel out the detonation code.

War is no reason to end a friendship."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's insane."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I first met him on the battlefield.  He was being held a prisoner of Outer Heaven.

I was still green and he showed me the ropes."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You knew him well?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No.  We never talked about our personal lives.

Why did you get into genetic research anyway?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I never knew who my parents were or even what they looked like. I guess I got into genetics because I wanted to figure out why I'm the way I am."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So you studied about DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yeah.

You don't like shots?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake listen up. It all went down five hours ago. Heavily armed soliders occupied Shadow Moses Island, a remote island off the coast of Alaska."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What soldiers?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Next-Generation Special Forces led by members of unit FOX-HOUND. They've presented Washington with a single demand, and they say that if it isn't met, they'll launch a nuclear weapon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A nuclear weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. You see, the island is the site of a secret nuclear weapons disposal facility."},{"character":"Snake","line":"FOX-HOUND hijacking a nuclear weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Now you understand how serious the situation is. You'll have two mission objectives. First, you're to rescue the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Chief, Donald Anderson, and the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker. They're both being held as hostages."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Those are some heavy duty hostages."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Secondly, you're to investigate whether or not the terrorists have the ability to launch a nuclear strike, and stop them if they do. Any questions, Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Questions? I haven't even said whether I'd accept this mission."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well you can make up your mind after you hear more about the situation."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about the nuclear weapons disposal facility."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The disposal facility includes a hardened underground base. Even with our most advanced intelligence gathering equipment, we can't tell what's happening inside."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So someone needs to penetrate, gather intelligence, and report back... Sounds like a spy movie. What's the insertion method?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well an air insertion is impossible."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Not with this storm going on."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll approach the disposal facility by sub."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Approach?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, within a few miles of it. The facility is equipped with sonar detection capability. They'd be able to hear our engine or propeller noise."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And then?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll launch a one-man SDV (swimmer delivery vehicle)."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Launch?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Same as a torpedo.

From there on you'll have to swim."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You want me to swim in sub-zero Alaskan water?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry. That suit represents the latest advances in poly- thermal technology. The nuclear weapons disposal facility covers the whole island. I'll contact you by Codec after you reach your target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Anyone going with me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"As usual, this is a one-man inflitration mission."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Weapons and equipment OSP (on-site procurement)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. This a top-secret black op. Don't expect any official support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Chief of DARPA and the president of an arms manufacturing company... what business did they have at a nuclear weapons disposal facility?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The truth is that secret exercises were being conducted at the time the terrorist group attacked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Must be extremely important exercises if those two were directly involved. Were they testing some kind of new advanced weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not privy to that information."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do we know exactly where they're being held?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The DARPA chief has also been injected with a mini-transmitter. As you get closer you should be able to pick up his location on your radar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do they really have the ability to launch a nuclear missile?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They say they do. They even gave us the serial number of the warhead they plan to use."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was the number confirmed?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. At the very least, they've got their hands on a real nuclear warhead."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Isn't there some kind of safety device to prevent this kind of terrorism?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. Every missile and warhead in our arsenal is equipped with a PAL, which uses a discreet detonation code."},{"character":"Snake","line":"PAL?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Permissive Action Link. A safety control system built into all nuclear weapons systems. But even so, we can't rest easy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why not?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because the DARPA Chief knows the detonation code."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But even if they have a nuclear warhead, it must've been removed from its missile. All the missiles on these disposal sites are supposed to be dismantled.

To be more accurate, cell specimens which contain the individual's genomic information."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Cell specimens? Why would they want that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The terrorists need them. You see these Next-Generation Special Forces have been strengthened through gene therapy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Strengthened?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You've heard of the Human Genome Project. They've been mapping the human genome, and they're nearly finished. Following up on this research, the military has been working towards identifiying those genes which are responsible for making effective soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There are genes that do that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and using gene therapy they're able to transplant those genes into regular soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Gene therapy?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I'll explain this part. With gene therapy, we can remove those genes which we know may lead to sickness or disease, and that the same time, splice in genes with beneficial effects such as resistance to cancer for example."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"In other words, we can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases and at the same time add genetic characteristics as desired."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, and so if you knew what genes were responsible for making the perfect soldier, you could implant them in the same way, right?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes we could."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But it all depends on being able to isolate and identify those \"soldier genes\"."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And in order to do that, it's helpful to study the genomic information of one of the greatest soldiers ever."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One of the greatest soldiers ever?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The man they call the greatest warrior of the twentieth century."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You don't mean Big Boss?!"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right. We've been working feverishly to identify the genes responsible for his incredible combat skill. So far we've discovered about sixty of the so-called \"soldier genes.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"So his body was recovered after all."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and his cells have remained frozen in cryo-chamber. His genomic information is a priceless treasure to mankind."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Priceless to the military perhaps."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"His body was burned severely, but it was possible to restore his DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) profile from just a single strand of his hair."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You people are amazing. And then you're going to transplant those genes into soldiers?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. We'll use a process that I discovered called gene targeting. The strongest soldiers don't become what they are by acquiring their skills through training or experience, we now know that hereditary factors are far more crucial for creating superior soldiers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, we can't give them his body. It's potentially more dangerous than all the warheads on that island put together."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I hear the terrorists are calling themselves the \"Sons of Big Boss.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the time limit?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"24 hours. They say they'll launch after 24 hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did they say what the target will be?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"So far they haven't mentioned a target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"When did the countdown start?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"5 hours ago."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, who are you speaking for?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Naturally, I'm representing the US government."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So who's in supervisory control of this operation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The President of the United States."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Which means that the President must be meeting with his top aides in the map room about now, huh?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No at this point they're still video conferencing with each other."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If that's a real nuclear warhead, shouldn't they issue a COG (Continuity of Government)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Not yet. The Secretary of Defense has operational control and is fully aware of the situation. After you infiltrate, if you determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities a COG will be issued."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well if they haven't relocated to nuclear shelter under Mount Washingtion, I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet. Is the National Security Agency in on this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. So is the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The DIA? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They'll be sending us some support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We don't need desk jockies. We need a nuclear weapons specialist."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Of course. A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned to us."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We need backup from a specialist. I'm just an amateur when it comes to nuclear weapons."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I know. That's why I've requested the assistance of a military analyst named Nastasha Romanenko.

They're tough enough to eat nails and ask for seconds."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The others are Next-Generation Special Forces. They're not your average grunts either."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They started out as an anti-terrorist special-ops unit made up of members from former biochem units, technical escort units, and the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Their purpose was to respond to threats involving next-generation weapons of mass destruction, including NBC (nuclear/biological/chemica) weapons."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Until \"they\" were added that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's \"they\"?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"These guys didn't start out as regular army."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a pretty international group. Mercenaries?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yeah. And it gets worse. Most of them were from a merc agency that I think you're familiar with. They were part of Big Boss' private guard. And after Big Boss went down, the military just bought out all their contracts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Outer Heaven."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"After that they were merged with our own VR unit, Force 21, and re-trained. If you ask me, these so-called \"Next-Generation Special Forces\" should to be called \"simulated soldiers.\" They have no real battle experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Video game players, huh?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy. They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers. Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by international law."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes, but those are just declarations not actual treaties."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit conspired in this attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"They're calling it a revolution."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Since they all went through the same gene therapy, they probably felt closer than brothers. They see the unit as their only family."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss. But if they were regular army, they must've been interviewed periodically by army counsellers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"According to their files, they all got straight A's on their psychological tests. They all seemed like fine, upstanding patriotic soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But they all took part in the uprising?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No. Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise. That's why there was a resupply of troops."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Apparently they consulted classified information about the soldier genes and performed their own gene therapy experiments."},{"character":"Snake","line":"They can do that even without you?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well our gene therapy process is almost completely automated. And besides that they're all geniuses with IQs over 180."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Even the existence of this genome army is a national secret of the highest order. We'd been hoping to investigate this quietly and deal with it behind closed doors."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Hi-Tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND. Your former unit, and one that I was a commander of. An elite group combining firepower and expertise. They're every bit as good as when I was commanding them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they're still around."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are six members of FOX-HOUND involved in this terrorist activity. Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities. Sniper Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter. Decoy Octopus, master of disguise. Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman. And Revolver Ocelot, specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a lovely bunch of folks. Too bad we'll be meeting under these circumstances."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"And finally, in charge of them, FOX-HOUND's squad leader Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake?!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes and you're the only person who can stand against him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Liquid Snake. The man with the same codename as you."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me what you know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager, the youngest person in the SAS (British Special Air Service).  His job was to track down and destroy mobile SCUD missile launching platforms. You were there too I believe. Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was just a kid myself back then."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The details are classified, but it seems that originally he penetrated the the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS."},{"character":"Snake","line":"He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But he never once showed his face in Century House. He was taken prisoner in Iraq, and after that there was no trace of him for several years. After you retired, he was rescued and became a member of FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using codenames."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know his real name. That information is so highly classified that even I can't look at it. Here's a photo of him.  Pretty shocking, huh?  His skin tone is a little different but otherwise you two are exact duplicates."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have a twin?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know the details, but it seems so. That's why we really need you for this mission."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're the only one who can beat him. Now that I've met you, I know. You've got something he doesn't. I can see it in your eyes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why don't I find that thought more comforting?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore. Let me go back to Twin Lakes."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Why Snake? Is your life in Alaska all that great?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's a dogsled race this week. Next Saturday I have to be in Anchorage."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The Iditarod? The longest sled race in the world? When did you become a dog musher?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Right now my fifty huskies are my only family. I've got to take care of them."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry about your dogs."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you mean?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry Snake but this vessel is headed for the Bering Sea. There's no room for debate."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I told you, even if I do owe you I don't anything to this army or this country!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You will accept this assignment!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why should I be stupid enough to do that? I'm no patriot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, there's enough dirt in your file from your days as an agent to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh I see. Blackmail."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No Snake. I prefer to look at it as helping you to come to a decision more easily. But anyway, I know you better than that. You'd take this assignment even without the threat."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why do you say that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You're a natural born soldier. You're not the grow old gracefully type. Same for all of us who've seen real action. The only place we can feel truly alive is on the battlefield. I'm a solider too. I know those feelings of powerlessness, frustration that you feel everyday. You've tried to play the boy scout out there in Alaska, but you can't race dogs in the snow forever.  Why don't you come back to us and be a soldier again."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You think my life is some kind of joke?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I just want to give you back your purpose in life."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're retired. Why are you involved in this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because there aren't many people who know FOX-HOUND as well as I do."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Is that really the only reason?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've been soldiering for a long time, I don't know anything else. I guess even though I'm getting a little old, I still love to be in the field."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're a lousy liar. Tell me the real reason."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Okay Snake. Sorry. I'll be frank. A person very dear to me is being held hostage."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who is it?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"My niece. Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What was your niece doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt. And my niece was one of those called in as an emergency replacement."},{"character":"Snake","line":"She looks like you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's my little brother's girl. He died in the Gulf War. Since then I've been watching after her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A personal motive, Colonel. That's not very soldierly."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm retired. I'm just an old man now. And I'm your friend."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Since when are we friends?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've thought of us as friends since the fall of Zanzibar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"With my personality I don't have too many friends."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's what I trust about you. It's what makes you human. Please Snake. Save my niece Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"All right, but I have two conditions."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Name them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One, no more secrets between us. I want complete disclosure at all times and two, I'll only accept orders from you, Colonel. No cutoffs involved okay?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Agreed. That's why I was called. But one thing."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not a colonel anymore. Just a retired old warhorse."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, Colonel."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That doctor. Is she part of this operation too?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She was in charge of FOX-HOUND's gene therapy. She knows more about those men than anyone else."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean you've seen them naked?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Make no mistake. I'm not a nurse. I'm a scientist."},{"character":"Snake","line":"By the way, what was that injection for?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It's a combination of and nanomachines and an anti-freezing peptide so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze, even at sub-arctic temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nanomachines?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Not just one kind either. There are different types which will replenish the supply of adrenaline, nutrition and sugar in your bloodstream."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Now I don't have to worry about food."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I also put some nootropics in there."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Say what?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Nootropics. It's a class of drugs which will help improve your mental functioning."},{"character":"Snake","line":"It'll make smarter huh? Anything else?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Benzedrine. It's a type of stimulant. It'll keep you alert and responsive for twelve straight hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That was quite a cocktail. Anything else in there?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Those nanomachines will also keep your Codec's batteries charged up."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're welcome."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I need to borrow your scissors."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"What are you going to do?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't worry. Just going to clean myself up a little."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Huh?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't want to be mistaken for the leader of the terrorists."},{"character":"action","line":""},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake swims through the lower dock of the disposal facility.  We see a man riding up the cargo elevator.)"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Stay alert!  He'll be through here, I know it.  I'm going to go swat down a couple of bothersome flies."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake removes his flippers and calls Campbell on the codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"This is Snake.  Colonel, can you hear me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Loud and clear Snake.  What's the situation?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Just as I expected.  You'll have to take the elevator to the surface.  But make sure that nobody sees you.  If you need to contact me by codec, the frequency is 140.85.  When you want to use the codec push the Select button. When we need to contact you the codec will beep.  When you hear that noise push the Select button. The codec directly stimulates the small bones of your ear, no one but you will be able to hear it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Got it, okay, I'm ready to go."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake takes off his scuba gear and watches the landscape slide by as the elevator ascends.  The title appears on the screen \"Metal Gear Solid\".  The elevator stops and Snake quickly runs out and looks for cover behind a storage crate.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It's Snake.  I'm in front of the disposal facility."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Excellent, Snake.  Age hasn't slowed you down one bit."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How's that Sneaking Suit working out?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm nice and dry, but it is a little hard to move."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Bear with it.  It's designed to prevent hypothermia.  This is Alaska you know."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Take it easy, I'm grateful.  If it wasn't for your suit and your shot I would have turned into a popsicle out there."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"An anti-freezing peptide Snake.  All of the Genome soldiers in this exercise are using it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm relieved to hear that.  Already tested, huh?  By the way, how's the diversionary operation going?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.  The terrorist's radar should have picked them up by now."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake peers out from behind the crate and sees a group of terrorists by a helicopter.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"A Hind D?  Colonel, what's a Russian gunship doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I have no idea...but it looks like our little diversion got their attention.  Now's your best chance to slip in unnoticed."},{"character":"action","line":"(The helicopter takes off, throwing snow in all directions, the guards on the ground shield their eyes as they follow it up into the sky.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are only 18 hours left until their deadline.  You've got to hurry."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Wow...you must be crazy to fly a Hind in this kind of weather."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Oh sorry, I haven't introduced you two yet.  This is Mei Ling.  She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist. She designed your codec, as well as your Soliton radar system. Contact her if you have any questions about either of them."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Nice to meet you Snake.  It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"What's wrong?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nothing...I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so...cute."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"You're just flattering me..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, I'm serious.  Now I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"C'mon, I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake... But I'm surprised, you're very frank for a trained killer."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting the man behind the legend...but first, let me explain about your Soliton radar system."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"The bright dot in the middle is you Snake.  The red dots are your enemies and the blue cone shape represents their field of vision."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Be careful Snake. The Genome soldiers have highly developed senses of hearing and vision due to their gene therapy.  Make sure you don't let them see you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"First I want you to infiltrate the disposal site and look for the DARPA Chief."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The DARPA Chief was injected with the same GPS transmitting nanomachines as you."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"He should appear on your radar as a green dot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Get whatever information you can from him about the terrorists.  If he's alive that is..."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Snake, your radar isn't affected by the weather, but if you're discovered by an enemy you won't be able to use it."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, it gets jammed easily I'm afraid."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Yes, it's all made from currently existing technology.  You won't be able to use it in an area with strong harmonic resonance.  So be careful."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll be monitoring your movements by radar... so contact us by Codec anytime  you want."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Got it.  I'll call if I'm feeling lonely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Seriously Snake.  We're here to back you up, so call if you need some information or advice."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"I'm also in charge of your mission data.  Contact me if you want me to record your current status.  My frequency is 140.96.  It's a dedicated frequency for saving data.  Don't forget it."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Remember, except for your binoculars you're naked.  You need to arm yourself with whatever weapons you can find."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember.  First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here, and then all my weapons are taken away.  Imagine yourself put in that position."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well, if yck in one you make it back in one piece, maybe I'll let you do a strip search on me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll hold you to that doctor.  By the way, sorry to dissapoint you but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How did you do that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"In my stomach.  Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach acids."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Cigarettes?  How are those going to help you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You never know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"If you want to get in, there's the front door."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake pulls out his binoculars and takes a look.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"It's the fastest way, but there's too much risk of being spotted by the enemy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't just knock on the door and ask them to let me in.  One sentry on the left and one on the right.  They're armed with \"five five sixers\" and pineapples..."},{"character":"action","line":"(As the guard on the right approaches Snake puts back his binoculars and hides behind the crate again.  Then he goes over to the left and pulls out his binoculars again.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"What about the air duct near the door?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake locates the duct but it is guarded, he pans up to the upper level of the facility.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There should also be a duct on the second floor."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake looks across to the walkway on the second floor to find the vent but his view is blocked by the railing.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't see it from here."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake lowers his binoculars and once again hides behind the crate.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'll let you decide the best COA.  I'm counting on you Snake."},{"character":"action","line":"(The game resumes and the player takes control.  Eventually, Snake enters the vent on the second floor of the facility, he gets a codec call from Master Miller, his old instructor.)"},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake, it's been a long time."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Master?  What are you doing here?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some peace and quiet.  I'm in retirement just like you.  Once in a while I still help train the Alaskan Scouts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Campbell told me about the situation here.  I thought I might be of some use."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you."},{"character":"Master","line":"Well, I know lots about survival in a harsh environment.  I've lived in Alaska longer than you, so call me if you have any questions about the flora or fauna out here.

Don't get careless now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Woman in the cell?"},{"character":"Genome 2","line":"Did something happen?"},{"character":"Genome 1","line":"There's an intruder."},{"character":"Genome 2","line":"Really?"},{"character":"Genome 1","line":"He's already done three people."},{"character":"Genome 2","line":"He's killed three people?"},{"character":"Genome 1","line":"Yeah.  They say he's using stealth too."},{"character":"Genome 2","line":"Stealth?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's an intruder besides me?"},{"character":"Genome 1","line":"Anyway, I want you to increase the security detail on the chief."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake finds the DARPA chief in his cell and drops down through a vent opening.)"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"Who... who, who's that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm here to save you.  You're the DARPA Chief, Donald Anderson, right?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"You're here to save me, huh?  What's your outfit?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm the pawn they sent here to save your worthless butt."},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"Really?  It's true... You don't look like one of them.  In that case, hurry up and get me out of here."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Slow down.  Don't worry.  First I want some information... about the terrorists."},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"The terrorists?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do they really have the ability to launch a nuke?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"What are you talking about?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"The terrorists are threatening the White House.

It's possible.  They... could launch a nuke."},{"character":"action","line":"(The woman in the next cell here this bit of information and stops the sit-ups she was doing.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"How do they plan to launch?  I though this place was just for keeping the dismantled warheads.  THey shouldn't have access to a missile..."},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"What I'm about to tell you is classified information. Okay?  We were conducting excercises of a new type of experimental weapon. A weapon that will change the world."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"A weapon with the ability to launch a nuclear attack from any place on the face of the earth.  A nuclear equipped, walking battle tank."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Metal Gear!?  It can't be!"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"... You knew!?  Metal Gear is one of the most secret black projects!  How did you know that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"We've had a couple of run-ins in the past.

It's set up so that you need to input two different passwords in order to launch the device."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There are two passwords?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"Yes.  Baker knows one and I know one."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Baker?  The president of ArmsTech?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"That's right.

You can stop the launch."},{"character":"action","line":"(The woman in the next cell hears this.)"},{"character":"Woman","line":"That card key... ?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"So where are the keys?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"Baker should have them.

Snake is now very confused.  He calls up Naomi on the Codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi, I just had some kind of hallucination.  Is it from the nanomachines?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"No Snake.  The nanomachines are funtioning properly."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So what was it?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It must have been psychometric interferance coming from Psycho Mantis.  FOX-HOUND's psychic.

You... you're from the Pentagon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Answer my question!  What about your code!?  There's no time!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I... talked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What! Now the terrorists have both codes and can launch anytime!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"It's not like I didn't fight.  I managed to resist Psycho Mantis's mind probe."},{"character":"Snake","line":"He couldn't read you?  How'd you do it?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Surgical implants in my brain."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Surgical implants?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Kind of like a psychic insulation.  Everybody who knows these top-secret codes has it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Even the DARPA Chief?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Of course."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But the DARPA Chief said Mantis got his code by reading his mind."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Are you sure you heard him right?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah, I'm sure.  In that case, how did they get your code?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I never had any training on how to resist torture..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker coughs violently, he is obviously in very bad shape.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It looks like he had some fun with you all right."},{"character":"Baker","line":"He's not human.  I tell you, he loved every second of it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What happened to your arm?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"He broke it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like you're more than even now.  His was sliced off."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Ha. You're a funny man.  ...So... the DARPA Chief... is he okay?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Dead."},{"character":"Baker","line":"What!?  It can't be!  You know that's not what you promised, Jim! Now you want to shut me up!"},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker begins to whack Snake's leg with his cane.  Snake quickly calms him down.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Calm down!  What's wrong with you?  I just told you I was here to save you!  I didn't kill the DARPA Chief.  He had a heart attack or something."},{"character":"Baker","line":"A heart attack? Oh, don't be a fool."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Anyway, the terrorists have both codes now."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Those boys are totally insane.  They wouldn't hesitate to launch."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I agree.  But what do they really want?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Who knows.  Maybe they're like us in the arms industry... always looking forward to the next good war."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well I'm not going to let these maniacs start a war toady.  Do you still have the card keys."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Card keys?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"To override tge detonation codes!  I heard you had them..."},{"character":"Baker","line":"No, not anymore."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What!?  Who does then!?  Not the terrorists!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"No, that woman."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Woman!?  Who!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"A soldier that was thrown in prison along with me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female soldier?  It must be..."},{"character":"Baker","line":"She said that she had just joined up as a new recruit.  She said they threw her in prison because she refused to take part in the rebellion."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A new recruit?  Could that be the Colonel's niece!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I gave her the key.  Looks like she managed to break out of here though. I hope she's okay."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sure she is.  She's green... but as tough as they come.  But how did you know she escaped?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I was in contact with her by Codec.  Until I was tied up here that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Codec?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  She stole it from the guard.  If she still has it, you should be able to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sure she still has it.  What frequency was she at?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh yeah.  Let me tell you.  It's..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker is struggling to remember.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Huh?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...Oh... sorry... I forgot..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh that's right!  It should be on the back of the CD case.  Try to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll contact her right away.  But tell me... If this doesn't work, is there some other way to prevent the missile launch?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Hmmm.  You need to find Hal Emmerich, one of my employees."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The team leader of the Metal Gear Rex project.  A genius at engineering, but a little bit of an oddball.  If there is anyone who can figure out how to stop Metal Gear from launching, it's him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What if he can't come up with anything?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You'll have to destroy it.  Emmerich knows how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where is this Emmerich?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Well... he's probably being held somewhere in the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building.  It's north from here.  That's where he worked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, but... why Metal Gear?  The Nuclear Age ended with the turn of the millenium."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You're wrong.  The threat of nuclear war isn't gone... in fact it's greater than it's ever been."},{"character":"action","line":"(Scenes of missile launches, storage buildings, and missile silos are shown.)"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The amount of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium is increasing even today.  Listen, have you ever seen a warehouse full of nuclear material?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...No."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Drums and drums of nuclear waste stacked this high.  As far as you can see because there's still no real way to dispose of the stuff."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they just close the lid and pretend like it'll go away?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Essentially, yes.  And they're not even doing a good job of storing it.  Many of the drums are corroded... with nuclear waste seeping out of them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Unbelievable."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Not only that, several pounds of MUF are reported every year."},{"character":"Snake","line":"MUF?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"It stands for \"material unnacounted for\". It proves that there is a large and well organized black market in nuclear materials. Furthermore, since the end of the Cold War, Russian nuclear engineers, in particular, are out of work with nowhere to turn."},{"character":"action","line":"(We go back to the chamber where Snake and Baker are conversing.)"},{"character":"Baker","line":"In other words, there is plenty of nuclear material and scientists for making a bomb.  We live in an age when any small country can have a nuclear weapons program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about the other superpowers?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Russia and China still maintain a signifigant nuclear presence. Complete nuclear disarmament is an impossibility.  To maintain our own policy of deterrance, we need a weapon of overwhelming power."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean Metal Gear."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You know our industry suffered quite a blow as a result of the cut-backs in military budgets, due to this so called \"peace\"."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember hearing a lot about mergers and take-overs among the big weapons makers."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  And after my company lost their bid to produce the Air Force's next fighter jet, the Metal Gear project was out last ace in the hole.  That's why we pushed to have Metal Gear developed as a black project."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Black project?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Secret projects paid for by the Pentagon's black budget.  You can avoid a lot of red tape a get a great lead-time on your weapons production.  And no one can bother you.  Not even those bleeding heart liberals on the military oversight committee."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Bribes."},{"character":"Baker","line":"I prefer to think of it as good buisness.  Anyway, Metal Gear was going to be formally adopted after the results of this exercise were analyzed."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't give a crap about you and your company."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes, that's about what I'd expect from a grunt like you... Here, this is what you came for, right?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker fishes a disc out of his pocket and hands it to Snake.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"An optical disk.  It's all here.  The main hard drive was destroyed by gunfire.  This is the only remaining copy of the data."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What kind of data?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"All the data collected from this exercise.  Don't play dumb.  I know you were sent to get this.  I hid it from that sadistic maniac while he was torturing me.  They don't know that this disk exists. Make sure that you report this to Jim... to your boss.  I'll give you my card too.  It'll open up all level two security doors."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Can you walk?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...No ...You go on without me.  They got my password... they don't want anything else from me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have one more question.  Who or what was that ninja thing?  It looked like you knew something."},{"character":"Baker","line":"That ninja?  That was FOX-HOUND's dark little secret."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Dark little secret?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"An experimantal... genome... soldier..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker coughs once more.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You know him?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You should ask Dr. Naomi Hunter from FOX-HOUND.  She knows better than I."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You've got to stop them.  If it goes public, my company and I are... finished."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?  Doesn't Metal Gear use currently existing technology?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Metal Gear itself does, but..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker bends over in pain.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Huh!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"What... what did you do to me!?  Uh... oooh...no!  ...Ooh.  Oh no, it can't be! ...those Pentagon bastards!  ...So they...they actually went ahead and did it!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"They... they're just... using you for... uuuhhh..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker slumps over and Snake stands in front of him stunned and confused.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What the hell?"},{"character":"action","line":"(After thinking for a moment he calls Campbell on the Codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel!  Are you listening?  Now he's dead too!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"...I have no idea!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't lie to me!"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It looked like another heart attcak but..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Some kind of poison!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well, there are a lot of drugs that can cause a heart attack in large doses.  For example. potassium chloride or dioxides... But... we won't be able to tell without doing an autopsy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I want you and Meryl to work together!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Can I trust her?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"...More than you can trust me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Get in contact with her."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Snake, there is a lot of electrical interferance coming from there. It should be okay if you do burst transmission like us but normal transmission is probably impossible.  Try moving away from that area."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, get a hold of yourself."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi, what the hell was that ninja thing?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"....."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A member of FOX-HOUND?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"No..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Are you sure?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes, we have no one like that in our unit."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Is that right?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I'm counting on you."},{"character":"action","line":"(The transmission ends and Snake is left to find Meryl's Codec frequency.  He does find it on the back of the CD case and contacts her.)"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Who are you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was really impressed with the way you busted yourself out of there."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"The one from the prison?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're the Colonel's niece, Meryl, right?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"....No... it's not him... Just exactly who are you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm the fool that your uncle sent all alone into the middle of this whole mess."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You came by yourself?  You think you're some kind of one-man army? You're not even armed."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I appreciate your help from before.  But... I don't need lectures. You're just like your uncle, you know."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"How do you know my uncle?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"We go way back."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"What's your name?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"My name's not important."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Aha!  Could you be Snake?  Are you Solid Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"That's what some people called me."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"The legendary Solid Snake...!  You!?  Sorry about before.  I wasn't sure if you were one of the good guys."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But I knew you were."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"How?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It's your eyes."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"My eyes?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"They're not soldiers eyes."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"They're rookie's eyes, right?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, they're beautiful compassionate eyes."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Just what I'd expect from the legendary Solid Snake.  You trying to sweep me off my feet?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't worry.  You'll land back on them once you meet me.  The reality is no match for the legend, I'm afraid."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I don't believe that."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why did you look surprised when you saw my face?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Because you look just like him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...You mean the terrorists leader, Liquid Snake?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Yeah, you know him?  You're not brothers are you!?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have no family."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"So, what's the deal then?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who knows.  Why don't you ask him?  But first I want some information.  You were involved in this excercise from the beginning. What exactly happened here?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I'm sorry.  I was captured along with President Baker right after the terrorist attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That's okay.  But what is this place?  I don't think it is just a nuclear wepaons disposal facility..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Boy oh boy... it's just like them!  Nobody told you anything, did they?  Okay... you see, this place isn't really for disposing nuclear weapons.  This base is owned and operated by a dummy corporation of ArmsTech."},{"character":"Snake","line":"This is a civilian base?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Right.  For the development of Metal Gear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel!"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"FOX-HOUND and the Next-Generation Special Forces were called here for the test launching of a dummy nuclear warhead."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why FOX-HOUND?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Because they're a Special Ops group used to handling top secret missions.  They figured they could keep it all hush-hush."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But we must have fired nuclear warheads before.  Why just this time?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I heard it was because this was to be a final test before the formal adoption of the Metal Gear program... that's what I heard anyway."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Hmmm... sounds kind of fishy...  So what do you think the terrorists want?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Sorry, I'm not sure.  I was captured with President Baker right after the revolt started."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh yeah, that's when he gave you the detonation override keys, right?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"That's right."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Amazing you were able to keep 'em hidden from the guards."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Well... women have more hiding places than men.  Anyway, you met up with Baker, huh?  How's he holding up?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"He's dead..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"What!?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Heart attack.  Same as the DARPA Chief."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"The Chief died from a heart attck too?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah, was either of them sick or anything?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"No, not that I heard of."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well, I don't believe in coincidences.  Something funny's going on."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Hmmm.  Sounds like it. But I have no idea what."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Me neither... yet.  Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You mean Dr. emmerich?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yes.  Is he still alive?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Probably.  he should be in the second floor basemant of the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building to the north."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Second floor basement?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Yeah, that's where his lab is.  I think they're forcing him to work on the nuclear launching program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Then we'd better do something before he finishes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're right.  In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You plan to take that thing on by yourself, Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It won't be the first time..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"........."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the best way to get to the building where the Doctor is being held?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"There's a cargo door on the first floor of this building that leads to the north."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the security level of the door there?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Five, but it's okay... I've got a level five card."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well, I've got to go save the Doctor.  You should go..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I'm going with you!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No way!  You're still too green.  I want you to hide somewhere."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I'm not green."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh yes you are."},{"character":"Meryl","line":".........."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You pause for just one second in front of your enemy and it's all over!  Good luck doesn't last forever!"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I don't know what happened.  I just couldn't pull the trigger right away.  I never had any problems in training... But when I thought about my bullets tearing through those soldiers' bodies, I hesitated."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Shooting at targets and shooting at living, breathing people are different."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Ever since I was a little girl, I always dreamed of being a soldier.  Every day of my life, I've trained my mind and my body for the one day when I could finally see some real action, and now"},{"character":"Snake","line":"So what now?  You wanna quit?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I can't quit.  I can't alow myself to quit now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Listen, Meryl.  Everybody feels sick the first time they kill someone.  Unfortunately, killing is one of those things that gets easier the more you do it.  In a war, all of mankind's worst emotions, worst traits come out. It's easy to forget what a sin is in the middle of a battlefield."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"But this isn't a war.  It's a terrorist action."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're just a little jumpy from the combat high.  The adrenaline in your blood is starting to whin out.  Just take it easy."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"But I learned all about combat high at the academy..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We'll talk about it later.  For now, just think about keeping yourself alive."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"If I get out of here alive, I'll think about that other stuff."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, let me try to say this another way... Stay the hell out of my way."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You're a real bastard, just like my uncle said."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Ha ha, I told you.  The real me is no match for the legend."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"It looks like you were right.  Okay Snake, I'll be a good girl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We'll link up after I grab the Doctor.  Then we'll take care of the detonation code override."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Got ya.  But listen, I know this area better than you.

You telling me I didn't know?"},{"character":"Emmerich","line":"They're going to put a nuclear missile into Metal Gear's TMD missile module?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Wrong.

It uses magnets to fire bullets at extremely high velocities.  The technology was originally developed for the SDI system and later scrapped.

But are you saying it was originally meant to carry nuclear missiles?"},{"character":"action","line":"(We are now back in the lab where Otacon and Snake are talking.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah, but that's not all I think.

They would need actual launch data."},{"character":"action","line":"(We are back in the lab.  Emmerich shows Snake some of the supercomputers used to do the testing)"},{"character":"Emmerich","line":"These are some of the supercomputers.  If you link these you can test everything in a virtual environment.

Where is Metal Gear?  Where on this base are they keeping it?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Rex is shown.)"},{"character":"Emmerich","line":"Rex is in the underground maintainence base."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where is that?"},{"character":"Emmerich","line":"North of the Communications Tower.

You better hurry. If they were planning a launch from the start, then their ballistic program is probably finished.  And since they haven't called for me in a few hours, they must not need me.  In other words, they must be ready to launch."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Meryl's got the detonation override keys.  We'll link up with her."},{"character":"Emmerich","line":"If we can't override the launch we'll have to destroy Rex."},{"character":"action","line":"(Back in the lab.)"},{"character":"Emmerich","line":"I'll show you the way."},{"character":"action","line":"(Emmerich makes to walk away but Snake stops him.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"On that leg of yours?

I just need your brain."},{"character":"Emmerich","line":"I created Rex. It's my right... my duty to destroy him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If you get a chance, try to escape.

I've got this."},{"character":"action","line":"(Emmerich reaches up to his shoulder and activates his stealth camouflage.)"},{"character":"Emmerich","line":"It's the same stealth technology as the ninja.

I didn't think a pencil pusher like him would be so tough."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Well... his mental defenses were reinforced by hypnotherapy."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Boss, what about that ninja?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"He killed 12 men.  Whoever he is, he's some kind of lunatic."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Bastard took my hand... How could he have gotten in here?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Perhaps there's a spy among us...

I'm about to show you some of its nicer features..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where are my things?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Oh don't worry.  They're all there.

That's the reason for the deadline."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right, Snake.  And that's why we can't let the terrorist attack go public."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We still haven't even ratified Start 2 or dealt with the issue of TMDs.  This has to do with the Presodent's reputation and America's place as the dominant superpower."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So patriotism is your excuse for circumventing the Constitution?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Please, Snake... just stop them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why should I?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because you're the only one who can."},{"character":"Snake","line":"In that case, tell me the truth about this new type of nuclear warhead."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I told you before.

It looks like they've got both codes and are nearly ready to launch."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Damn.  Is there any way to prevent it?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It seems there's some type of emergency override device that can cancel out the detonation code.  It's a countermeasure that ArmsTech installed secretly.

We did.  In Zanzibar.  But it was nothing personal. We were just proffesionals on opposite sides, that's all."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And you still call yourselves friends?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Hard to believe?  War is no reason to end a friendship."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's insane."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I first met him on the battlefield.  He was being held a prisoner of Outer Heaven.  But he didn't look like a prisoner to me.  He was always so cool and precise.  I was still green and he showed me the ropes."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You knew him well?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No.  We never talked about our personal lives.  Sort of an unwritten rule.  The nest time I saw him on the battlefield, we were enemies.  We were fighting barehanded in a minefield.  I know it sounds strange to most people.

We are animals."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"So if you were friends, then how do you explain the Ninja's behavior?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't know."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It's your genes... they make you predisposed towards violence!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You really like talking about genes, Naomi.  Why did you get into genetic research anyway?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I never knew who my parents were or even what they looked like. I guess I got into genetics because I wanted to figure out why I'm the way I am."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So you studied about DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yeah.  I thought if I studied my genetic structure, I'd find out who I really was.  I thought that by analyzing a person's genetic information, I could retrieve the blank spots in that person's memory."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Memory is stored in DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"We're not sure.  But we know that a person's genetic fate is determined just by the sequence of the four bases in their DNA."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So what about my fate? You know my DNA sequence, don't you?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Your fate?  I...I'm sorry.  I have no idea."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Of course not.

You don't like shots?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake listen up. It all went down five hours ago. Heavily armed soliders occupied Shadow Moses Island, a remote island off the coast of Alaska."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What soldiers?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Next-Generation Special Forces led by members of unit FOX-HOUND. They've presented Washington with a single demand, and they say that if it isn't met, they'll launch a nuclear weapon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A nuclear weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. You see, the island is the site of a secret nuclear weapons disposal facility."},{"character":"Snake","line":"FOX-HOUND hijacking a nuclear weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Now you understand how serious the situation is. You'll have two mission objectives. First, you're to rescue the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Chief, Donald Anderson, and the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker. They're both being held as hostages."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Those are some heavy duty hostages."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Secondly, you're to investigate whether or not the terrorists have the ability to launch a nuclear strike, and stop them if they do. Any questions, Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Questions? I haven't even said whether I'd accept this mission."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well you can make up your mind after you hear more about the situation."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about the nuclear weapons disposal facility."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The disposal facility includes a hardened underground base. Even with our most advanced intelligence gathering equipment, we can't tell what's happening inside."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So someone needs to penetrate, gather intelligence, and report back... Sounds like a spy movie. What's the insertion method?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well an air insertion is impossible."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Not with this storm going on."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll approach the disposal facility by sub."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Approach?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, within a few miles of it. The facility is equipped with sonar detection capability. They'd be able to hear our engine or propeller noise."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And then?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll launch a one-man SDV (swimmer delivery vehicle)."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Launch?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Same as a torpedo. Only this has no propulsion device of its own. After the SDV gets as close as it can, dispose of it. From there on you'll have to swim."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You want me to swim in sub-zero Alaskan water?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry. That suit represents the latest advances in poly- thermal technology. The nuclear weapons disposal facility covers the whole island. I'll contact you by Codec after you reach your target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Anyone going with me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"As usual, this is a one-man inflitration mission."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Weapons and equipment OSP (on-site procurement)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. This a top-secret black op. Don't expect any official support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Chief of DARPA and the president of an arms manufacturing company... what business did they have at a nuclear weapons disposal facility?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The truth is that secret exercises were being conducted at the time the terrorist group attacked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Must be extremely important exercises if those two were directly involved. Were they testing some kind of new advanced weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not privy to that information."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do we know exactly where they're being held?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The DARPA chief has also been injected with a mini-transmitter. As you get closer you should be able to pick up his location on your radar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do they really have the ability to launch a nuclear missile?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They say they do. They even gave us the serial number of the warhead they plan to use."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was the number confirmed?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. At the very least, they've got their hands on a real nuclear warhead."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Isn't there some kind of safety device to prevent this kind of terrorism?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. Every missile and warhead in our arsenal is equipped with a PAL, which uses a discreet detonation code."},{"character":"Snake","line":"PAL?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Permissive Action Link. A safety control system built into all nuclear weapons systems. But even so, we can't rest easy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why not?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because the DARPA Chief knows the detonation code."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But even if they have a nuclear warhead, it must've been removed from its missile. All the missiles on these disposal sites are supposed to be dismantled. It's not that easy to get your hands on an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missle)."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That used to be true, but since the end of the Cold War you can get anything if you have enough money and the right connections."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So what exactly are they demanding?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"A person's remains."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Remains?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's right. To be more accurate, cell specimens which contain the individual's genomic information."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Cell specimens? Why would they want that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The terrorists need them. You see these Next-Generation Special Forces have been strengthened through gene therapy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Strengthened?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You've heard of the Human Genome Project. They've been mapping the human genome, and they're nearly finished. Following up on this research, the military has been working towards identifiying those genes which are responsible for making effective soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There are genes that do that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and using gene therapy they're able to transplant those genes into regular soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Gene therapy?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I'll explain this part. With gene therapy, we can remove those genes which we know may lead to sickness or disease, and that the same time, splice in genes with beneficial effects such as resistance to cancer for example."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"In other words, we can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases and at the same time add genetic characteristics as desired."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, and so if you knew what genes were responsible for making the perfect soldier, you could implant them in the same way, right?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes we could."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But it all depends on being able to isolate and identify those \"soldier genes\"."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And in order to do that, it's helpful to study the genomic information of one of the greatest soldiers ever."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One of the greatest soldiers ever?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The man they call the greatest warrior of the twentieth century."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You don't mean Big Boss?!"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right. We've been working feverishly to identify the genes responsible for his incredible combat skill. So far we've discovered about sixty of the so-called \"soldier genes.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"So his body was recovered after all."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and his cells have remained frozen in cryo-chamber. His genomic information is a priceless treasure to mankind."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Priceless to the military perhaps."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"His body was burned severely, but it was possible to restore his DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) profile from just a single strand of his hair."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You people are amazing. And then you're going to transplant those genes into soldiers?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. We'll use a process that I discovered called gene targeting. The strongest soldiers don't become what they are by acquiring their skills through training or experience, we now know that hereditary factors are far more crucial for creating superior soldiers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, we can't give them his body. It's potentially more dangerous than all the warheads on that island put together."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I hear the terrorists are calling themselves the \"Sons of Big Boss.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the time limit?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"24 hours. They say they'll launch after 24 hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did they say what the target will be?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"So far they haven't mentioned a target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"When did the countdown start?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"5 hours ago."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, who are you speaking for?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Naturally, I'm representing the US government."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So who's in supervisory control of this operation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The President of the United States."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Which means that the President must be meeting with his top aides in the map room about now, huh?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No at this point they're still video conferencing with each other."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If that's a real nuclear warhead, shouldn't they issue a COG (Continuity of Government)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Not yet. The Secretary of Defense has operational control and is fully aware of the situation. After you infiltrate, if you determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities a COG will be issued."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well if they haven't relocated to nuclear shelter under Mount Washingtion, I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet. Is the National Security Agency in on this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. So is the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The DIA? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They'll be sending us some support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We don't need desk jockies. We need a nuclear weapons specialist."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Of course. A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned to us."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We need backup from a specialist. I'm just an amateur when it comes to nuclear weapons."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I know. That's why I've requested the assistance of a military analyst named Nastasha Romanenko. She'll be providing you backup by Codec."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female analyst?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's built up an impressive record as an advisor to the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Contact her if you have any questions. She's also an expert on hi-tech weapons."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where's she working from?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"At her home in Los Angeles."},{"character":"Snake","line":"California. Seems like a million miles away."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How well-armed are these terrorists? I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They're heavily armed I'm afraid."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about they're battle experience."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The six members of FOX-HOUND in charge are all hardened veterans. They're tough enough to eat nails and ask for seconds."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The others are Next-Generation Special Forces. They're not your average grunts either."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They started out as an anti-terrorist special-ops unit made up of members from former biochem units, technical escort units, and the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Their purpose was to respond to threats involving next-generation weapons of mass destruction, including NBC (nuclear/biological/chemica) weapons."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Until \"they\" were added that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's \"they\"?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"These guys didn't start out as regular army."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a pretty international group. Mercenaries?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yeah. And it gets worse. Most of them were from a merc agency that I think you're familiar with. They were part of Big Boss' private guard. And after Big Boss went down, the military just bought out all their contracts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Outer Heaven."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"After that they were merged with our own VR unit, Force 21, and re-trained. If you ask me, these so-called \"Next-Generation Special Forces\" should to be called \"simulated soldiers.\" They have no real battle experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Video game players, huh?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy. They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers. Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by international law."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes, but those are just declarations not actual treaties."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit conspired in this attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"They're calling it a revolution."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Since they all went through the same gene therapy, they probably felt closer than brothers. They see the unit as their only family."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss. But if they were regular army, they must've been interviewed periodically by army counsellers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"According to their files, they all got straight A's on their psychological tests. They all seemed like fine, upstanding patriotic soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But they all took part in the uprising?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No. Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise. That's why there was a resupply of troops."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Apparently they consulted classified information about the soldier genes and performed their own gene therapy experiments."},{"character":"Snake","line":"They can do that even without you?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well our gene therapy process is almost completely automated. And besides that they're all geniuses with IQs over 180."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Even the existence of this genome army is a national secret of the highest order. We'd been hoping to investigate this quietly and deal with it behind closed doors."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Hi-Tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND. Your former unit, and one that I was a commander of. An elite group combining firepower and expertise. They're every bit as good as when I was commanding them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they're still around."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are six members of FOX-HOUND involved in this terrorist activity. Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities. Sniper Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter. Decoy Octopus, master of disguise. Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman. And Revolver Ocelot, specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a lovely bunch of folks. Too bad we'll be meeting under these circumstances."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"And finally, in charge of them, FOX-HOUND's squad leader Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake?!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes and you're the only person who can stand against him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Liquid Snake. The man with the same codename as you."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me what you know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager, the youngest person in the SAS (British Special Air Service).  His job was to track down and destroy mobile SCUD missile launching platforms. You were there too I believe. Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was just a kid myself back then."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The details are classified, but it seems that originally he penetrated the the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS."},{"character":"Snake","line":"He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But he never once showed his face in Century House. He was taken prisoner in Iraq, and after that there was no trace of him for several years. After you retired, he was rescued and became a member of FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using codenames."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know his real name. That information is so highly classified that even I can't look at it. Here's a photo of him.  Pretty shocking, huh?  His skin tone is a little different but otherwise you two are exact duplicates."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have a twin?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know the details, but it seems so. That's why we really need you for this mission."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're the only one who can beat him. Now that I've met you, I know. You've got something he doesn't. I can see it in your eyes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why don't I find that thought more comforting?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore. Let me go back to Twin Lakes."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Why Snake? Is your life in Alaska all that great?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's a dogsled race this week. Next Saturday I have to be in Anchorage."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The Iditarod? The longest sled race in the world? When did you become a dog musher?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Right now my fifty huskies are my only family. I've got to take care of them."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry about your dogs."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you mean?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry Snake but this vessel is headed for the Bering Sea. There's no room for debate."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I told you, even if I do owe you I don't anything to this army or this country!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You will accept this assignment!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why should I be stupid enough to do that? I'm no patriot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, there's enough dirt in your file from your days as an agent to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh I see. Blackmail."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No Snake. I prefer to look at it as helping you to come to a decision more easily. But anyway, I know you better than that. You'd take this assignment even without the threat."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why do you say that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You're a natural born soldier. You're not the grow old gracefully type. Same for all of us who've seen real action. The only place we can feel truly alive is on the battlefield. I'm a solider too. I know those feelings of powerlessness, frustration that you feel everyday. You've tried to play the boy scout out there in Alaska, but you can't race dogs in the snow forever.

Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What was your niece doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt.

He died in the Gulf War. Since then I've been watching after her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A personal motive, Colonel. That's not very soldierly."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm retired. I'm just an old man now. And I'm your friend."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Since when are we friends?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've thought of us as friends since the fall of Zanzibar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"With my personality I don't have too many friends."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's what I trust about you.

Save my niece Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"All right, but I have two conditions."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Name them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One, no more secrets between us.

But one thing."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not a colonel anymore. Just a retired old warhorse."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, Colonel."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That doctor.

I'm a scientist."},{"character":"Snake","line":"By the way, what was that injection for?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It's a combination of and nanomachines and an anti-freezing peptide so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze, even at sub-arctic temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nanomachines?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Not just one kind either. There are different types which will replenish the supply of adrenaline, nutrition and sugar in your bloodstream."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Now I don't have to worry about food."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I also put some nootropics in there."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Say what?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Nootropics. It's a class of drugs which will help improve your mental functioning."},{"character":"Snake","line":"It'll make smarter huh? Anything else?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Benzedrine. It's a type of stimulant. It'll keep you alert and responsive for twelve straight hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That was quite a cocktail.

Colonel, can you hear me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Loud and clear Snake.  What's the situation?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Just as I expected.  You'll have to take the elevator to the surface.  But make sure that nobody sees you.  If you need to contact me by codec, the frequency is 140.85.  When you want to use the codec push the Select button. When we need to contact you the codec will beep.  When you hear that noise push the Select button.

Age hasn't slowed you down one bit."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How's that Sneaking Suit working out?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm nice and dry, but it is a little hard to move."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Bear with it.  It's designed to prevent hypothermia.  This is Alaska you know."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Take it easy, I'm grateful.  If it wasn't for your suit and your shot I would have turned into a popsicle out there."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"An anti-freezing peptide Snake.  All of the Genome soldiers in this exercise are using it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm relieved to hear that.  Already tested, huh?  By the way, how's the diversionary operation going?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.

Colonel, what's a Russian gunship doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I have no idea...but it looks like our little diversion got their attention.

This is Mei Ling.  She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist. She designed your codec, as well as your Soliton radar system.

It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"What's wrong?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nothing...I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so...cute."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"You're just flattering me..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, I'm serious.  Now I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"C'mon, I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake...

The red dots are your enemies and the blue cone shape represents their field of vision."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Be careful Snake. The Genome soldiers have highly developed senses of hearing and vision due to their gene therapy.  Make sure you don't let them see you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"First I want you to infiltrate the disposal site and look for the DARPA Chief."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The DARPA Chief was injected with the same GPS transmitting nanomachines as you."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"He should appear on your radar as a green dot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Get whatever information you can from him about the terrorists.

We're here to back you up, so call if you need some information or advice."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"I'm also in charge of your mission data.

Don't forget it."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Remember, except for your binoculars you're naked.  You need to arm yourself with whatever weapons you can find."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember.  First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here, and then all my weapons are taken away.  Imagine yourself put in that position."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well, if yck in one you make it back in one piece, maybe I'll let you do a strip search on me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll hold you to that doctor.  By the way, sorry to dissapoint you but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How did you do that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"In my stomach.  Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach acids."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Cigarettes?  How are those going to help you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You never know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"If you want to get in, there's the front door."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake pulls out his binoculars and takes a look.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"It's the fastest way, but there's too much risk of being spotted by the enemy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't just knock on the door and ask them to let me in.

What are you doing here?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some peace and quiet.  I'm in retirement just like you.  Once in a while I still help train the Alaskan Scouts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Campbell told me about the situation here.

We were conducting excercises of a new type of experimental weapon. A weapon that will change the world."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"A weapon with the ability to launch a nuclear attack from any place on the face of the earth.

Baker knows one and I know one."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Baker?  The president of ArmsTech?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"That's right.

The DARPA Chief told me he gave them his detonation code.  What about yours?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh, I get it.  Jim sent you... You... you're from the Pentagon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Answer my question!  What about your code!?  There's no time!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I... talked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What! Now the terrorists have both codes and can launch anytime!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"It's not like I didn't fight.  I managed to resist Psycho Mantis's mind probe."},{"character":"Snake","line":"He couldn't read you?  How'd you do it?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Surgical implants in my brain."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Surgical implants?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Kind of like a psychic insulation.  Everybody who knows these top-secret codes has it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Even the DARPA Chief?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Of course."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But the DARPA Chief said Mantis got his code by reading his mind."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Are you sure you heard him right?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah, I'm sure.  In that case, how did they get your code?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I never had any training on how to resist torture..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker coughs violently, he is obviously in very bad shape.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It looks like he had some fun with you all right."},{"character":"Baker","line":"He's not human.  I tell you, he loved every second of it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What happened to your arm?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"He broke it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like you're more than even now.  His was sliced off."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Ha. You're a funny man.  ...So... the DARPA Chief... is he okay?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Dead."},{"character":"Baker","line":"What!?  It can't be!  You know that's not what you promised, Jim! Now you want to shut me up!"},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker begins to whack Snake's leg with his cane.  Snake quickly calms him down.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Calm down!  What's wrong with you?  I just told you I was here to save you!  I didn't kill the DARPA Chief.  He had a heart attack or something."},{"character":"Baker","line":"A heart attack? Oh, don't be a fool."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Anyway, the terrorists have both codes now."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Those boys are totally insane.  They wouldn't hesitate to launch."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I agree.  But what do they really want?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Who knows.  Maybe they're like us in the arms industry... always looking forward to the next good war."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well I'm not going to let these maniacs start a war toady.  Do you still have the card keys."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Card keys?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"To override tge detonation codes!  I heard you had them..."},{"character":"Baker","line":"No, not anymore."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What!?  Who does then!?  Not the terrorists!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"No, that woman."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Woman!?  Who!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"A soldier that was thrown in prison along with me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female soldier?  It must be..."},{"character":"Baker","line":"She said that she had just joined up as a new recruit.  She said they threw her in prison because she refused to take part in the rebellion."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A new recruit?  Could that be the Colonel's niece!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I gave her the key.  Looks like she managed to break out of here though. I hope she's okay."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sure she is.  She's green... but as tough as they come.  But how did you know she escaped?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I was in contact with her by Codec.  Until I was tied up here that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Codec?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  She stole it from the guard.  If she still has it, you should be able to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sure she still has it.  What frequency was she at?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh yeah.  Let me tell you.  It's..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker is struggling to remember.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Huh?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...Oh... sorry... I forgot..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh that's right!  It should be on the back of the CD case.  Try to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll contact her right away.  But tell me... If this doesn't work, is there some other way to prevent the missile launch?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Hmmm.  You need to find Hal Emmerich, one of my employees."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The team leader of the Metal Gear Rex project.  A genius at engineering, but a little bit of an oddball.  If there is anyone who can figure out how to stop Metal Gear from launching, it's him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What if he can't come up with anything?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You'll have to destroy it.  Emmerich knows how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where is this Emmerich?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Well... he's probably being held somewhere in the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building.  It's north from here.  That's where he worked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, but... why Metal Gear?  The Nuclear Age ended with the turn of the millenium."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You're wrong.  The threat of nuclear war isn't gone... in fact it's greater than it's ever been."},{"character":"action","line":"(Scenes of missile launches, storage buildings, and missile silos are shown.)"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The amount of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium is increasing even today.  Listen, have you ever seen a warehouse full of nuclear material?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...No."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Drums and drums of nuclear waste stacked this high.  As far as you can see because there's still no real way to dispose of the stuff."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they just close the lid and pretend like it'll go away?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Essentially, yes.  And they're not even doing a good job of storing it.  Many of the drums are corroded... with nuclear waste seeping out of them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Unbelievable."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Not only that, several pounds of MUF are reported every year."},{"character":"Snake","line":"MUF?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"It stands for \"material unnacounted for\". It proves that there is a large and well organized black market in nuclear materials. Furthermore, since the end of the Cold War, Russian nuclear engineers, in particular, are out of work with nowhere to turn."},{"character":"action","line":"(We go back to the chamber where Snake and Baker are conversing.)"},{"character":"Baker","line":"In other words, there is plenty of nuclear material and scientists for making a bomb.  We live in an age when any small country can have a nuclear weapons program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about the other superpowers?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Russia and China still maintain a signifigant nuclear presence. Complete nuclear disarmament is an impossibility.  To maintain our own policy of deterrance, we need a weapon of overwhelming power."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean Metal Gear."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You know our industry suffered quite a blow as a result of the cut-backs in military budgets, due to this so called \"peace\"."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember hearing a lot about mergers and take-overs among the big weapons makers."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  And after my company lost their bid to produce the Air Force's next fighter jet, the Metal Gear project was out last ace in the hole.  That's why we pushed to have Metal Gear developed as a black project."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Black project?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Secret projects paid for by the Pentagon's black budget.  You can avoid a lot of red tape a get a great lead-time on your weapons production.  And no one can bother you.  Not even those bleeding heart liberals on the military oversight committee."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Bribes."},{"character":"Baker","line":"I prefer to think of it as good buisness.  Anyway, Metal Gear was going to be formally adopted after the results of this exercise were analyzed."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't give a crap about you and your company."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes, that's about what I'd expect from a grunt like you... Here, this is what you came for, right?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker fishes a disc out of his pocket and hands it to Snake.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"An optical disk.  It's all here.  The main hard drive was destroyed by gunfire.  This is the only remaining copy of the data."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What kind of data?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"All the data collected from this exercise.  Don't play dumb.  I know you were sent to get this.  I hid it from that sadistic maniac while he was torturing me.  They don't know that this disk exists. Make sure that you report this to Jim... to your boss.  I'll give you my card too.  It'll open up all level two security doors."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Can you walk?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...No ...You go on without me.  They got my password... they don't want anything else from me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have one more question.  Who or what was that ninja thing?  It looked like you knew something."},{"character":"Baker","line":"That ninja?  That was FOX-HOUND's dark little secret."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Dark little secret?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"An experimantal... genome... soldier..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker coughs once more.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You know him?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You should ask Dr. Naomi Hunter from FOX-HOUND.  She knows better than I."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You've got to stop them.  If it goes public, my company and I are... finished."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?  Doesn't Metal Gear use currently existing technology?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Metal Gear itself does, but..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker bends over in pain.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Huh!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"What... what did you do to me!?  Uh... oooh...no!  ...Ooh.  Oh no, it can't be! ...those Pentagon bastards!  ...So they...they actually went ahead and did it!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"They... they're just... using you for... uuuhhh..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker slumps over and Snake stands in front of him stunned and confused.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What the hell?"},{"character":"action","line":"(After thinking for a moment he calls Campbell on the Codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel!

For example. potassium chloride or dioxides... But... we won't be able to tell without doing an autopsy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I want you and Meryl to work together!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Can I trust her?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"...More than you can trust me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Get in contact with her."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Snake, there is a lot of electrical interferance coming from there.

Just exactly who are you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm the fool that your uncle sent all alone into the middle of this whole mess."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You came by yourself?  You think you're some kind of one-man army? You're not even armed."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I appreciate your help from before.  But... I don't need lectures.

Could you be Snake?  Are you Solid Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"That's what some people called me."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"The legendary Solid Snake...!  You!?  Sorry about before.

The reality is no match for the legend, I'm afraid."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I don't believe that."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why did you look surprised when you saw my face?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Because you look just like him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...You mean the terrorists leader, Liquid Snake?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Yeah, you know him?  You're not brothers are you!?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have no family."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"So, what's the deal then?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who knows.  Why don't you ask him?  But first I want some information.  You were involved in this excercise from the beginning. What exactly happened here?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I'm sorry.  I was captured along with President Baker right after the terrorist attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That's okay.  But what is this place?  I don't think it is just a nuclear wepaons disposal facility..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Boy oh boy... it's just like them!  Nobody told you anything, did they?  Okay... you see, this place isn't really for disposing nuclear weapons.  This base is owned and operated by a dummy corporation of ArmsTech."},{"character":"Snake","line":"This is a civilian base?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Right.  For the development of Metal Gear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel!"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"FOX-HOUND and the Next-Generation Special Forces were called here for the test launching of a dummy nuclear warhead."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why FOX-HOUND?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Because they're a Special Ops group used to handling top secret missions.  They figured they could keep it all hush-hush."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But we must have fired nuclear warheads before.  Why just this time?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I heard it was because this was to be a final test before the formal adoption of the Metal Gear program... that's what I heard anyway."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Hmmm... sounds kind of fishy...  So what do you think the terrorists want?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Sorry, I'm not sure.  I was captured with President Baker right after the revolt started."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh yeah, that's when he gave you the detonation override keys, right?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"That's right."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Amazing you were able to keep 'em hidden from the guards."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Well... women have more hiding places than men.  Anyway, you met up with Baker, huh?  How's he holding up?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"He's dead..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"What!?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Heart attack.  Same as the DARPA Chief."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"The Chief died from a heart attck too?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah, was either of them sick or anything?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"No, not that I heard of."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well, I don't believe in coincidences.  Something funny's going on."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Hmmm.  Sounds like it. But I have no idea what."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Me neither... yet.  Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You mean Dr. emmerich?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yes.  Is he still alive?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Probably.  he should be in the second floor basemant of the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building to the north."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Second floor basement?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Yeah, that's where his lab is.  I think they're forcing him to work on the nuclear launching program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Then we'd better do something before he finishes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're right.  In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You plan to take that thing on by yourself, Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It won't be the first time..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"........."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the best way to get to the building where the Doctor is being held?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"There's a cargo door on the first floor of this building that leads to the north."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the security level of the door there?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Five, but it's okay... I've got a level five card."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well, I've got to go save the Doctor.  You should go..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I'm going with you!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No way!  You're still too green.

Good luck doesn't last forever!"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I don't know what happened.  I just couldn't pull the trigger right away.  I never had any problems in training...

You wanna quit?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I can't quit.  I can't alow myself to quit now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Listen, Meryl.  Everybody feels sick the first time they kill someone.  Unfortunately, killing is one of those things that gets easier the more you do it.  In a war, all of mankind's worst emotions, worst traits come out. It's easy to forget what a sin is in the middle of a battlefield."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"But this isn't a war.  It's a terrorist action."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're just a little jumpy from the combat high.  The adrenaline in your blood is starting to whin out.  Just take it easy."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"But I learned all about combat high at the academy..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We'll talk about it later.  For now, just think about keeping yourself alive."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"If I get out of here alive, I'll think about that other stuff."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, let me try to say this another way... Stay the hell out of my way."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You're a real bastard, just like my uncle said."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Ha ha, I told you.  The real me is no match for the legend."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"It looks like you were right.  Okay Snake, I'll be a good girl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We'll link up after I grab the Doctor.  Then we'll take care of the detonation code override."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Got ya.

You don't like shots?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake listen up. It all went down five hours ago. Heavily armed soliders occupied Shadow Moses Island, a remote island off the coast of Alaska."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What soldiers?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Next-Generation Special Forces led by members of unit FOX-HOUND. They've presented Washington with a single demand, and they say that if it isn't met, they'll launch a nuclear weapon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A nuclear weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. You see, the island is the site of a secret nuclear weapons disposal facility."},{"character":"Snake","line":"FOX-HOUND hijacking a nuclear weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Now you understand how serious the situation is. You'll have two mission objectives. First, you're to rescue the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Chief, Donald Anderson, and the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker. They're both being held as hostages."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Those are some heavy duty hostages."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Secondly, you're to investigate whether or not the terrorists have the ability to launch a nuclear strike, and stop them if they do. Any questions, Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Questions? I haven't even said whether I'd accept this mission."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well you can make up your mind after you hear more about the situation."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about the nuclear weapons disposal facility."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The disposal facility includes a hardened underground base. Even with our most advanced intelligence gathering equipment, we can't tell what's happening inside."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So someone needs to penetrate, gather intelligence, and report back... Sounds like a spy movie. What's the insertion method?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well an air insertion is impossible."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Not with this storm going on."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll approach the disposal facility by sub."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Approach?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, within a few miles of it. The facility is equipped with sonar detection capability. They'd be able to hear our engine or propeller noise."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And then?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll launch a one-man SDV (swimmer delivery vehicle)."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Launch?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Same as a torpedo. Only this has no propulsion device of its own. After the SDV gets as close as it can, dispose of it. From there on you'll have to swim."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You want me to swim in sub-zero Alaskan water?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry. That suit represents the latest advances in poly- thermal technology. The nuclear weapons disposal facility covers the whole island. I'll contact you by Codec after you reach your target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Anyone going with me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"As usual, this is a one-man inflitration mission."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Weapons and equipment OSP (on-site procurement)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. This a top-secret black op. Don't expect any official support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Chief of DARPA and the president of an arms manufacturing company... what business did they have at a nuclear weapons disposal facility?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The truth is that secret exercises were being conducted at the time the terrorist group attacked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Must be extremely important exercises if those two were directly involved. Were they testing some kind of new advanced weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not privy to that information."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do we know exactly where they're being held?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The DARPA chief has also been injected with a mini-transmitter. As you get closer you should be able to pick up his location on your radar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do they really have the ability to launch a nuclear missile?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They say they do. They even gave us the serial number of the warhead they plan to use."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was the number confirmed?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. At the very least, they've got their hands on a real nuclear warhead."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Isn't there some kind of safety device to prevent this kind of terrorism?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. Every missile and warhead in our arsenal is equipped with a PAL, which uses a discreet detonation code."},{"character":"Snake","line":"PAL?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Permissive Action Link. A safety control system built into all nuclear weapons systems. But even so, we can't rest easy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why not?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because the DARPA Chief knows the detonation code."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But even if they have a nuclear warhead, it must've been removed from its missile. All the missiles on these disposal sites are supposed to be dismantled. It's not that easy to get your hands on an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missle)."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That used to be true, but since the end of the Cold War you can get anything if you have enough money and the right connections."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So what exactly are they demanding?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"A person's remains."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Remains?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's right. To be more accurate, cell specimens which contain the individual's genomic information."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Cell specimens? Why would they want that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The terrorists need them. You see these Next-Generation Special Forces have been strengthened through gene therapy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Strengthened?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You've heard of the Human Genome Project. They've been mapping the human genome, and they're nearly finished. Following up on this research, the military has been working towards identifiying those genes which are responsible for making effective soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There are genes that do that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and using gene therapy they're able to transplant those genes into regular soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Gene therapy?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I'll explain this part. With gene therapy, we can remove those genes which we know may lead to sickness or disease, and that the same time, splice in genes with beneficial effects such as resistance to cancer for example."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"In other words, we can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases and at the same time add genetic characteristics as desired."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, and so if you knew what genes were responsible for making the perfect soldier, you could implant them in the same way, right?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes we could."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But it all depends on being able to isolate and identify those \"soldier genes\"."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And in order to do that, it's helpful to study the genomic information of one of the greatest soldiers ever."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One of the greatest soldiers ever?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The man they call the greatest warrior of the twentieth century."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You don't mean Big Boss?!"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right. We've been working feverishly to identify the genes responsible for his incredible combat skill. So far we've discovered about sixty of the so-called \"soldier genes.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"So his body was recovered after all."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and his cells have remained frozen in cryo-chamber. His genomic information is a priceless treasure to mankind."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Priceless to the military perhaps."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"His body was burned severely, but it was possible to restore his DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) profile from just a single strand of his hair."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You people are amazing. And then you're going to transplant those genes into soldiers?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. We'll use a process that I discovered called gene targeting. The strongest soldiers don't become what they are by acquiring their skills through training or experience, we now know that hereditary factors are far more crucial for creating superior soldiers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, we can't give them his body. It's potentially more dangerous than all the warheads on that island put together."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I hear the terrorists are calling themselves the \"Sons of Big Boss.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the time limit?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"24 hours. They say they'll launch after 24 hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did they say what the target will be?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"So far they haven't mentioned a target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"When did the countdown start?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"5 hours ago."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, who are you speaking for?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Naturally, I'm representing the US government."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So who's in supervisory control of this operation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The President of the United States."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Which means that the President must be meeting with his top aides in the map room about now, huh?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No at this point they're still video conferencing with each other."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If that's a real nuclear warhead, shouldn't they issue a COG (Continuity of Government)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Not yet. The Secretary of Defense has operational control and is fully aware of the situation. After you infiltrate, if you determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities a COG will be issued."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well if they haven't relocated to nuclear shelter under Mount Washingtion, I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet. Is the National Security Agency in on this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. So is the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The DIA? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They'll be sending us some support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We don't need desk jockies. We need a nuclear weapons specialist."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Of course. A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned to us."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We need backup from a specialist. I'm just an amateur when it comes to nuclear weapons."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I know. That's why I've requested the assistance of a military analyst named Nastasha Romanenko. She'll be providing you backup by Codec."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female analyst?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's built up an impressive record as an advisor to the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Contact her if you have any questions. She's also an expert on hi-tech weapons."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where's she working from?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"At her home in Los Angeles."},{"character":"Snake","line":"California. Seems like a million miles away."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How well-armed are these terrorists? I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They're heavily armed I'm afraid."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about they're battle experience."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The six members of FOX-HOUND in charge are all hardened veterans. They're tough enough to eat nails and ask for seconds."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The others are Next-Generation Special Forces. They're not your average grunts either."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They started out as an anti-terrorist special-ops unit made up of members from former biochem units, technical escort units, and the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Their purpose was to respond to threats involving next-generation weapons of mass destruction, including NBC (nuclear/biological/chemica) weapons."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Until \"they\" were added that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's \"they\"?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"These guys didn't start out as regular army."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a pretty international group. Mercenaries?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yeah. And it gets worse. Most of them were from a merc agency that I think you're familiar with. They were part of Big Boss' private guard. And after Big Boss went down, the military just bought out all their contracts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Outer Heaven."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"After that they were merged with our own VR unit, Force 21, and re-trained. If you ask me, these so-called \"Next-Generation Special Forces\" should to be called \"simulated soldiers.\" They have no real battle experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Video game players, huh?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy. They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers. Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by international law."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes, but those are just declarations not actual treaties."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit conspired in this attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"They're calling it a revolution."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Since they all went through the same gene therapy, they probably felt closer than brothers. They see the unit as their only family."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss. But if they were regular army, they must've been interviewed periodically by army counsellers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"According to their files, they all got straight A's on their psychological tests. They all seemed like fine, upstanding patriotic soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But they all took part in the uprising?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No. Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise. That's why there was a resupply of troops."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Apparently they consulted classified information about the soldier genes and performed their own gene therapy experiments."},{"character":"Snake","line":"They can do that even without you?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well our gene therapy process is almost completely automated. And besides that they're all geniuses with IQs over 180."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Even the existence of this genome army is a national secret of the highest order. We'd been hoping to investigate this quietly and deal with it behind closed doors."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Hi-Tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND. Your former unit, and one that I was a commander of. An elite group combining firepower and expertise. They're every bit as good as when I was commanding them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they're still around."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are six members of FOX-HOUND involved in this terrorist activity. Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities. Sniper Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter. Decoy Octopus, master of disguise. Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman. And Revolver Ocelot, specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a lovely bunch of folks. Too bad we'll be meeting under these circumstances."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"And finally, in charge of them, FOX-HOUND's squad leader Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake?!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes and you're the only person who can stand against him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Liquid Snake. The man with the same codename as you."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me what you know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager, the youngest person in the SAS (British Special Air Service).  His job was to track down and destroy mobile SCUD missile launching platforms. You were there too I believe. Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was just a kid myself back then."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The details are classified, but it seems that originally he penetrated the the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS."},{"character":"Snake","line":"He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But he never once showed his face in Century House. He was taken prisoner in Iraq, and after that there was no trace of him for several years. After you retired, he was rescued and became a member of FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using codenames."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know his real name. That information is so highly classified that even I can't look at it. Here's a photo of him.  Pretty shocking, huh?  His skin tone is a little different but otherwise you two are exact duplicates."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have a twin?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know the details, but it seems so. That's why we really need you for this mission."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're the only one who can beat him. Now that I've met you, I know. You've got something he doesn't. I can see it in your eyes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why don't I find that thought more comforting?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore. Let me go back to Twin Lakes."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Why Snake? Is your life in Alaska all that great?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's a dogsled race this week. Next Saturday I have to be in Anchorage."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The Iditarod? The longest sled race in the world? When did you become a dog musher?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Right now my fifty huskies are my only family. I've got to take care of them."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry about your dogs."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you mean?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry Snake but this vessel is headed for the Bering Sea. There's no room for debate."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I told you, even if I do owe you I don't anything to this army or this country!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You will accept this assignment!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why should I be stupid enough to do that? I'm no patriot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, there's enough dirt in your file from your days as an agent to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh I see. Blackmail."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No Snake. I prefer to look at it as helping you to come to a decision more easily. But anyway, I know you better than that. You'd take this assignment even without the threat."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why do you say that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You're a natural born soldier. You're not the grow old gracefully type. Same for all of us who've seen real action. The only place we can feel truly alive is on the battlefield. I'm a solider too. I know those feelings of powerlessness, frustration that you feel everyday. You've tried to play the boy scout out there in Alaska, but you can't race dogs in the snow forever.

He died in the Gulf War. Since then I've been watching after her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A personal motive, Colonel. That's not very soldierly."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm retired. I'm just an old man now.

But one thing."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not a colonel anymore. Just a retired old warhorse."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, Colonel."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That doctor.

I'm a scientist."},{"character":"Snake","line":"By the way, what was that injection for?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It's a combination of and nanomachines and an anti-freezing peptide so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze, even at sub-arctic temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nanomachines?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Not just one kind either. There are different types which will replenish the supply of adrenaline, nutrition and sugar in your bloodstream."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Now I don't have to worry about food."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I also put some nootropics in there."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Say what?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Nootropics.

Colonel, can you hear me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Loud and clear Snake.  What's the situation?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Just as I expected.  You'll have to take the elevator to the surface.  But make sure that nobody sees you.  If you need to contact me by codec, the frequency is 140.85.

Age hasn't slowed you down one bit."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How's that Sneaking Suit working out?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm nice and dry, but it is a little hard to move."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Bear with it.

If it wasn't for your suit and your shot I would have turned into a popsicle out there."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"An anti-freezing peptide Snake.  All of the Genome soldiers in this exercise are using it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm relieved to hear that.  Already tested, huh?  By the way, how's the diversionary operation going?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.

This is Mei Ling.  She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist. She designed your codec, as well as your Soliton radar system.

It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"What's wrong?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nothing...I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so...cute."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"You're just flattering me..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, I'm serious.

My hand!!!"},{"character":"action","line":"(The figure quickly slices down all of the wires connected to the C4 and the ropes binding Baker to the support pillar.  he falls to the ground as the C4 explodes around him.

The DARPA Chief told me he gave them his detonation code.  What about yours?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh, I get it.  Jim sent you... You... you're from the Pentagon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Answer my question!  What about your code!?  There's no time!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I... talked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What! Now the terrorists have both codes and can launch anytime!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"It's not like I didn't fight.  I managed to resist Psycho Mantis's mind probe."},{"character":"Snake","line":"He couldn't read you?  How'd you do it?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Surgical implants in my brain."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Surgical implants?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Kind of like a psychic insulation.  Everybody who knows these top-secret codes has it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Even the DARPA Chief?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Of course."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But the DARPA Chief said Mantis got his code by reading his mind."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Are you sure you heard him right?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah, I'm sure.  In that case, how did they get your code?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I never had any training on how to resist torture..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker coughs violently, he is obviously in very bad shape.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It looks like he had some fun with you all right."},{"character":"Baker","line":"He's not human.  I tell you, he loved every second of it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What happened to your arm?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"He broke it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like you're more than even now.  His was sliced off."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Ha. You're a funny man.  ...So... the DARPA Chief... is he okay?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Dead."},{"character":"Baker","line":"What!?  It can't be!  You know that's not what you promised, Jim! Now you want to shut me up!"},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker begins to whack Snake's leg with his cane.  Snake quickly calms him down.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Calm down!  What's wrong with you?  I just told you I was here to save you!  I didn't kill the DARPA Chief.  He had a heart attack or something."},{"character":"Baker","line":"A heart attack? Oh, don't be a fool."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Anyway, the terrorists have both codes now."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Those boys are totally insane.  They wouldn't hesitate to launch."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I agree.  But what do they really want?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Who knows.  Maybe they're like us in the arms industry... always looking forward to the next good war."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well I'm not going to let these maniacs start a war toady.  Do you still have the card keys."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Card keys?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"To override tge detonation codes!  I heard you had them..."},{"character":"Baker","line":"No, not anymore."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What!?  Who does then!?  Not the terrorists!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"No, that woman."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Woman!?  Who!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"A soldier that was thrown in prison along with me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female soldier?  It must be..."},{"character":"Baker","line":"She said that she had just joined up as a new recruit.  She said they threw her in prison because she refused to take part in the rebellion."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A new recruit?  Could that be the Colonel's niece!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I gave her the key.  Looks like she managed to break out of here though. I hope she's okay."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sure she is.  She's green... but as tough as they come.  But how did you know she escaped?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I was in contact with her by Codec.  Until I was tied up here that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Codec?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  She stole it from the guard.  If she still has it, you should be able to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sure she still has it.  What frequency was she at?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh yeah.  Let me tell you.  It's..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker is struggling to remember.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Huh?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...Oh... sorry... I forgot..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh that's right!  It should be on the back of the CD case.  Try to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll contact her right away.  But tell me... If this doesn't work, is there some other way to prevent the missile launch?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Hmmm.  You need to find Hal Emmerich, one of my employees."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The team leader of the Metal Gear Rex project.  A genius at engineering, but a little bit of an oddball.  If there is anyone who can figure out how to stop Metal Gear from launching, it's him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What if he can't come up with anything?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You'll have to destroy it.  Emmerich knows how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where is this Emmerich?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Well... he's probably being held somewhere in the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building.  It's north from here.  That's where he worked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, but... why Metal Gear?  The Nuclear Age ended with the turn of the millenium."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You're wrong.  The threat of nuclear war isn't gone... in fact it's greater than it's ever been."},{"character":"action","line":"(Scenes of missile launches, storage buildings, and missile silos are shown.)"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The amount of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium is increasing even today.  Listen, have you ever seen a warehouse full of nuclear material?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...No."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Drums and drums of nuclear waste stacked this high.  As far as you can see because there's still no real way to dispose of the stuff."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they just close the lid and pretend like it'll go away?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Essentially, yes.  And they're not even doing a good job of storing it.  Many of the drums are corroded... with nuclear waste seeping out of them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Unbelievable."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Not only that, several pounds of MUF are reported every year."},{"character":"Snake","line":"MUF?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"It stands for \"material unnacounted for\". It proves that there is a large and well organized black market in nuclear materials. Furthermore, since the end of the Cold War, Russian nuclear engineers, in particular, are out of work with nowhere to turn."},{"character":"action","line":"(We go back to the chamber where Snake and Baker are conversing.)"},{"character":"Baker","line":"In other words, there is plenty of nuclear material and scientists for making a bomb.  We live in an age when any small country can have a nuclear weapons program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about the other superpowers?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Russia and China still maintain a signifigant nuclear presence. Complete nuclear disarmament is an impossibility.  To maintain our own policy of deterrance, we need a weapon of overwhelming power."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean Metal Gear."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You know our industry suffered quite a blow as a result of the cut-backs in military budgets, due to this so called \"peace\"."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember hearing a lot about mergers and take-overs among the big weapons makers."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  And after my company lost their bid to produce the Air Force's next fighter jet, the Metal Gear project was out last ace in the hole.  That's why we pushed to have Metal Gear developed as a black project."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Black project?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Secret projects paid for by the Pentagon's black budget.  You can avoid a lot of red tape a get a great lead-time on your weapons production.  And no one can bother you.  Not even those bleeding heart liberals on the military oversight committee."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Bribes."},{"character":"Baker","line":"I prefer to think of it as good buisness.  Anyway, Metal Gear was going to be formally adopted after the results of this exercise were analyzed."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't give a crap about you and your company."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes, that's about what I'd expect from a grunt like you... Here, this is what you came for, right?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker fishes a disc out of his pocket and hands it to Snake.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"An optical disk.  It's all here.  The main hard drive was destroyed by gunfire.  This is the only remaining copy of the data."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What kind of data?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"All the data collected from this exercise.  Don't play dumb.  I know you were sent to get this.  I hid it from that sadistic maniac while he was torturing me.  They don't know that this disk exists. Make sure that you report this to Jim... to your boss.  I'll give you my card too.  It'll open up all level two security doors."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Can you walk?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...No ...You go on without me.  They got my password... they don't want anything else from me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have one more question.  Who or what was that ninja thing?  It looked like you knew something."},{"character":"Baker","line":"That ninja?  That was FOX-HOUND's dark little secret."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Dark little secret?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"An experimantal... genome... soldier..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker coughs once more.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You know him?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You should ask Dr. Naomi Hunter from FOX-HOUND.  She knows better than I."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You've got to stop them.  If it goes public, my company and I are... finished."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?  Doesn't Metal Gear use currently existing technology?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Metal Gear itself does, but..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker bends over in pain.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Huh!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"What... what did you do to me!?  Uh... oooh...no!  ...Ooh.  Oh no, it can't be! ...those Pentagon bastards!  ...So they...they actually went ahead and did it!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"They... they're just... using you for... uuuhhh..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker slumps over and Snake stands in front of him stunned and confused.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What the hell?"},{"character":"action","line":"(After thinking for a moment he calls Campbell on the Codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel!

For example. potassium chloride or dioxides... But... we won't be able to tell without doing an autopsy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I want you and Meryl to work together!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Can I trust her?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"...More than you can trust me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Get in contact with her."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Snake, there is a lot of electrical interferance coming from there.

Just exactly who are you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm the fool that your uncle sent all alone into the middle of this whole mess."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You came by yourself?  You think you're some kind of one-man army? You're not even armed."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I appreciate your help from before.  But... I don't need lectures.

Could you be Snake?  Are you Solid Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"That's what some people called me."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"The legendary Solid Snake...!  You!?  Sorry about before.

The reality is no match for the legend, I'm afraid."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I don't believe that."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why did you look surprised when you saw my face?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Because you look just like him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...You mean the terrorists leader, Liquid Snake?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Yeah, you know him?  You're not brothers are you!?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have no family."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"So, what's the deal then?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who knows.  Why don't you ask him?  But first I want some information.  You were involved in this excercise from the beginning. What exactly happened here?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I'm sorry.  I was captured along with President Baker right after the terrorist attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That's okay.  But what is this place?  I don't think it is just a nuclear wepaons disposal facility..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Boy oh boy... it's just like them!  Nobody told you anything, did they?  Okay... you see, this place isn't really for disposing nuclear weapons.  This base is owned and operated by a dummy corporation of ArmsTech."},{"character":"Snake","line":"This is a civilian base?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Right.  For the development of Metal Gear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel!"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"FOX-HOUND and the Next-Generation Special Forces were called here for the test launching of a dummy nuclear warhead."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why FOX-HOUND?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Because they're a Special Ops group used to handling top secret missions.  They figured they could keep it all hush-hush."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But we must have fired nuclear warheads before.  Why just this time?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I heard it was because this was to be a final test before the formal adoption of the Metal Gear program... that's what I heard anyway."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Hmmm... sounds kind of fishy...  So what do you think the terrorists want?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Sorry, I'm not sure.  I was captured with President Baker right after the revolt started."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh yeah, that's when he gave you the detonation override keys, right?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"That's right."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Amazing you were able to keep 'em hidden from the guards."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Well... women have more hiding places than men.  Anyway, you met up with Baker, huh?  How's he holding up?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"He's dead..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"What!?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Heart attack.  Same as the DARPA Chief."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"The Chief died from a heart attck too?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah, was either of them sick or anything?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"No, not that I heard of."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well, I don't believe in coincidences.  Something funny's going on."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Hmmm.  Sounds like it. But I have no idea what."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Me neither... yet.  Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You mean Dr. emmerich?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yes.  Is he still alive?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Probably.  he should be in the second floor basemant of the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building to the north."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Second floor basement?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Yeah, that's where his lab is.  I think they're forcing him to work on the nuclear launching program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Then we'd better do something before he finishes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're right.  In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You plan to take that thing on by yourself, Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It won't be the first time..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"........."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the best way to get to the building where the Doctor is being held?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"There's a cargo door on the first floor of this building that leads to the north."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the security level of the door there?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Five, but it's okay... I've got a level five card."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well, I've got to go save the Doctor.  You should go..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I'm going with you!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No way!  You're still too green.

Good luck doesn't last forever!"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I don't know what happened.  I just couldn't pull the trigger right away.  I never had any problems in training...

You wanna quit?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I can't quit.  I can't alow myself to quit now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Listen, Meryl.  Everybody feels sick the first time they kill someone.  Unfortunately, killing is one of those things that gets easier the more you do it.  In a war, all of mankind's worst emotions, worst traits come out.

It's a terrorist action."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're just a little jumpy from the combat high.  The adrenaline in your blood is starting to whin out.  Just take it easy."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"But I learned all about combat high at the academy..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We'll talk about it later.  For now, just think about keeping yourself alive."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"If I get out of here alive, I'll think about that other stuff."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, let me try to say this another way... Stay the hell out of my way."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You're a real bastard, just like my uncle said."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Ha ha, I told you.  The real me is no match for the legend."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"It looks like you were right.  Okay Snake, I'll be a good girl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We'll link up after I grab the Doctor.  Then we'll take care of the detonation code override."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Got ya.

Just as I thought, the nuclear warhead is designed to be fired from the rail gun, like a projectile... It doesn't use fuel so it isn't considered a missile. That way it can get around all sorts of international treaties."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Pretty sneaky."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yes, but effective.  And that's not even the scariest thing about this weapon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't wait to hear this."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"It's a stealth weapon!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean it won't show up on radar?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah.  The truth is... they've been working on a stealth missile since the late 70's."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why weren't they able to develope one until now?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Because of the missile's rocket propulsion system... it will be picked up by enemy satellites."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh yeah, that makes sense."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"But unlike a missile, the rail gun doesn't burn any propellant.  So it can't be detected by any current ballistic missile detection systems."},{"character":"Snake","line":"An invisible nuclear warhead..."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Totally impossible to intercept.  And on top of that, it's got a surface piercing warhead designed to penetrate hardened underground bases."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We learned that lesson in the Gulf War."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"This thing could mean the end of the world!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It's the ultimate weapon.  And from a political point of view, it avoids the problem of nuclear reduction and nuclear inspections. Colonel, is this true?  Are you listening?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm listening..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If word of this got out, it could delay the signing of the Start 3 Treaty and cause a huge international incident."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah, it would be nasty.  The United States would be denounced by the UN... it could even bring the President down..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did you know this, Colonel?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You've changed, Colonel."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I won't make any excuses..."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Snake, listen to me.  This new nuclear weapon... it's never actually been tested, only simulated."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean they ran a computer model?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah, that's why they were conducting this excercise.  They needed to get actual data to back up the simulation."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What were the results of the excercise?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"It looks like it went better than they hoped for.  But...I can't find the data anywhere on this network.  You'd think that data as important as that would be carefully recorded..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"It was.

Do you still have it?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, Ocelot took it from me."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Damn..."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"The terrorists have replaced the dummy warhead with a real warhead. Once they input the detonation codes, they should be ready to launch."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So you think they can do it?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Well the dummy warhead was designed to be identical to the real thing, so I think so."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did you find out how to override it yet?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Not yet.  It must be in a separate file.  Right now, I'm looking through all of Baker's personal files."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We're counting on you..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake enters the control center of the Rex hangar.  He sees Liquid and Ocelot talking.)"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Okay. I've entered the PAL codes and disengaged the safety device.

It looks like we'll have to show them that we mean business."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Should I set it for Chernoton, Russia?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"No, there's been a change. The new target is...Lopnor, China."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Why Boss?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"I'm sure neither you nor Mr. Gurlukovich would really like to see a nuclear bomb dropped on your Motherland, right?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid!"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"But why? There's nothing there."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Wrong. It's a nuclear test site."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"A nuclear test site?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"If we nuke a major population center, the game's over... But a nuclear explosion at a test site can still be concealed from the public. Meanwhile Washington will be worried about the retaliatory strike from China."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"That'll probably mean top secret talks between both countries' leaders..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Of course. And in the process, the President will be forced to divulge the existence of a new and highly destabilizing nuclear weapon to the Chinese. What do you think that will do to the U.S.'s reputation? Or the President's?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"And with the CTBT, that means that China and India... I see..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Yes. When the other countries hear about this new weapon, they'll all want to contact us. Washington won't be very happy when we start selling their own system to the highest bidders. Yes. The President will break. He will give in to our demands."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Big Boss's DNA and one billion dollars..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One billion dollars!"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"That money will be used to cure our genome soldiers as well. I'm also including the FoxDie vaccine in our demands."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"FoxDie... It killed Octopus and the ArmsTech president... So it's true that it affects older people first. Mantis might not have been affected because he wore a mask."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Wolf wasn't infected either. Perhaps due to those tranquilizers she always took."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Something to do with the adrenaline level in the blood? Or maybe it's just because this FoxDie was still experimental and they haven't worked out all the bugs yet..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"In any case, have you heard from your friend, Colonel Sergei Gurlukovich at the Spetznaz?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"He still has doubts about the ability of Metal Gear. He said we can talk after Metal Gear's test launch is successful."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"He is a very prudent man."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"There's nothing to worry about. The Colonel wants Metal Gear and the new nuclear weapon so bad he can taste it. If Russia wants to regain its position as a military superpower, they need to reinforce their nuclear arsenal. They need a nuclear weapon that can't be intercepted. Metal Gear will allow them to gain first strike capability over the rest of the world."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Their regular army is in shambles and they think they can restore their country's military power with nuclear weapons? Gurlukovich... he's no warrior... he is a politician."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"But he's the one who gave us the Hind and most of our other heavy firepower."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"He's got over a thousand soldiers under his command. If we joined forces we could put up quite a resistance here. Since Mantis died, the genome soldiers' brainwashing has started to wear off. I'm worried about the men's morale. An alliance with the Russians would boost that as well..."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"What are you saying?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"We're not going anywhere. We're going to dig in here."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"We could still escape..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"We've got the most powerful weapon ever made and we're about to ally with Gurlukovich's forces."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Are you going to fight the whole world?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"And what's wrong with that? We can launch a nuclear warhead at any target on this planet... A nuclear warhead invisible to radar. And on top of that, this base is full of spare nuclear warheads. Once we get the DNA and the money, the world will be ours!"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"What about your promise to Colonel Gurlukovich?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"I have no interest in the revival of Mother Russia."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"...You're not thinking of reviving Big Boss's dream?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"From today, ...call this place \"Outer Heaven\"."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Big Boss's dream..."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"But Boss,... you're not worried about the PAL being overridden? If the code is entered again, it'll be deactivated."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"No need to worry. The DARPA Chief and the ArmsTech president are both dead."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Does Snake know how the override system works?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"You interrogated him. Don't you know?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"He didn't have any keys on him."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Good. Then no one can stop Metal Gear now."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"By the way, what should we do with that woman? Want me to kill her?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Let her live. She's Campbell's niece and Snake cares for her... We'll keep her as our ace in-the-hole."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Meryl... she's alive."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Snake, I found Baker's top-secret files!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Great job."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"How's it going there?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"They've finished inputting the PAL codes. So how do we deactivate them?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Okay...y'see the override system that the president was talking about... It can also be used to input the detonation codes. Y'see if you insert the keys when the warhead is active, you deactivate it. And if you insert them when it's inactive, it becomes activated. And you can only use the keys once."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Only once, huh."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah...you'd better get started. We don't have much time."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But it takes three keys, right!? I've only got one of them!"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Hold on a minute. Y'see that's the trick. You already have all three keys!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"The card key is made of a shape memory alloy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Shape memory alloy?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yes. It's a material that changes shape at different temperatures. The key is made out of it!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"This card key?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah. The card key changes shape at different temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So this key is actually three keys in one...clever."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Can you see the input terminals in the center of the Control Room..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I see them."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Those three laptop terminals are for the emergency input. There should be a symbol on each screen... Each symbol corresponds to a different key. Input the keys in order from left to right. The left one's for the room temperature key. See the symbol? Next to that goes the low temperature key. The one on the right is the high temperature key."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, I got it. First I change the shape of the card and then I input them in order, right?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"That's right. All you do is insert the card keys. After you insert the key into the module, a hard disk reads the information contained on it. Once you've finished with all three terminals, the code input process is complete. But here's the thing. You can only use the key three times. It's an emergency system and it's only meant to be used once."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The world is riding on that key, Snake."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Who's that!!"},{"character":"action","line":"(Ocelot fires a bullet at Snake.

I don't know all the details, but..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you trying to say?"},{"character":"Master","line":"It's too similar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What is!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"The cause of death. Didn't the ArmsTech president and the DARPA Chief, I mean Decoy Octopus,... die of something that looked like a heart attack?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah...?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Well, apparently Fox Die kills its victims by simulating a heart attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No... You're telling me that Naomi was behind it?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake, try to remember. Did Naomi give you some kind of injection?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...The nanomachines."},{"character":"Master","line":"She was in the best position to have done it, but I don't know what her motive was."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...Does the Colonel know?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I'm not sure. But he still hasn't questioned her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay. I'll ask him myself. Colonel, what's new with the Naomi situation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I just placed Naomi under arrest."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Arrest?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She was sending coded messages towards the Alaskan base. I didn't want to believe it, but she must be working with the terrorists."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Are you sure?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. She's being interrogated now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What kind of interrogation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well...I'd like to avoid the rough stuff, but we don't even have any sodium pentathol here."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Call me if you find out anything."},{"character":"Master","line":"So it's true, isn't it?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi...I can't believe it."},{"character":"Master","line":"That means the Fox Die vaccine must be around somewhere."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Listen. I've got bigger things to worry about."},{"character":"Master","line":"But Snake...you might be infected too, you know."},{"character":"Snake","line":"All I can do is leave it up to the Colonel."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake goes to input the rest of the PAL Codes and during the process he gets a Codec call.)"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Snake, can you hear me?  It's Naomi..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi!? ...what the hell!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Campbell and the others are busy right now...I'm on a different Codec."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi, is what the Colonel says true?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...Yes.  But not everything I said was a lie. I don't know myself. I don't know my real name or even what my parents looked like.  I bought all my identification. But my reason for getting into genetics was true."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Cause you want to know yourself, right?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right. I want to know where I came from...m...my age, my race... anything."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I was found in Rhodesia sometime in the 80's... a dirty little orphan..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Rhodesia? What's now known as Zimbabwe?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. Rhodesia was owned by England until 1965 and there were lots of Indian laborers around.  That's probably where I got my skin color from, but I'm not even sure about that..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi, you're too worried about the past. Isn't it enough to understand who you are now?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Understand who I am now!?  Why should I? No one else tries to understand me.  I was alone for so long... until I met my big brother and him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Your big brother?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes.... Frank Jaeger."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"He was a young soldier, when he picked me up near the Zambezi River.  I was half-dead from starvation and he shared his rations with me."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. Frank Jaeger, the man who you destroyed, was my brother and my only family."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Gray Fox?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"We survived that hell together, Frank and I.  He protected me. He's my one connection... the only connection that I have to my past."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And he brought you back to America?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"No.  I was in Mozambique when \"he\" came."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who is \"he\" ? ...You mean Big Boss?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"He brought us to this land of freedom , this America. But then he and my brother went back to Africa to continue the war.  And that's when it happened... You killed my benefactor and sent my brother home a cripple.  I vowed revenge and joined FOX-HOUND.  I knew it was my best chance to meet you and I prayed for the day that I ould..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So were your prayers answered?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. I waited two long years..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"To kill me?  Is that all you cared about?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. That's right.  Two years.  You were all I thought about for two long years...like some kind of twisted obsession..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do you still hate me?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...Not exactly.  I was partly wrong about you..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about Liquid and the others?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"No. I'll have my revenge on them too."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi...you didn't kill that doctor too, did you?  The one that used Gray Fox for his genome experiments..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...No...that was my brother.  Afterwards I covered it up and helped him hide out..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So that Ninja...I mean Gray Fox... he's come here to kill me?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...I don't think so.  I think he just came here to fight you... I wasn't sure before, but now I think I understand.  A final battle with you... that's all he lives for. I'm sure of it..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...Fox...no... Naomi, tell me something..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...about FoxDie?  FoxDie is a type of retrovirus that targets and kills only specific people.  First, it infects the macrophages in the victim's body.  FoxDie contains smart enzymes, created through protein engineering.  They're programmed to respond to specific genetic patterns in the cells."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Those enzymes recognize the target's DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Right. They respond by becoming active, and using the macrophages, they begin creating TNF epsilon.  It's a type of cytokine, a peptide which causes cells to die.  The TNF epsilon is carried along the bloodstream to the heart, where they attach to the TNF receptors in the heart cells."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And then...they cause a heart attack?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The heart cells suffer a shock and undergo an extreme apoptosis. Then... the victim dies."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Apoptosis...you mean the heart cells commit suicide... Naomi..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...What?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...You must have programmed that thing to kill me too, right? Do I still have time? Naomi, I don't blame you for wanting me dead.  But I can't go yet. I still have a job to do."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Listen, Snake.  I'm not the one who made the decision to use FoxDie."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You weren't?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You were injected with FoxDie as a part of this operation. I just wanted to let you know that... No, that's not the whole truth... the real thing that I wanted to tell you was... Snake, I... I..."},{"character":"Voice","line":"Hey! What are you doing!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Eeeek!!  Ooooh.... Snake....."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"...Snake, I can't allow Naomi to make any more unauthorized transmissions.  Naomi's been removed from this operation."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What happened to Naomi!? What did she mean when she said that FoxDie was a part of this operation!?  Colonel, let me talk to her!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I won't. She's under arrest."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...you double crossed me!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, there's no time for that!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Right now your job is to stop Metal Gear! ...Okay, Snake!?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake inputs the second PAL code.)"},{"character":"Computer","line":"PAL code number two conirmed.  Awaiting PAL code number three."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, there goes PAL code number two. Next comes PAL number three... warm the key."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake Inputs the third PAL code.)"},{"character":"Computer","line":"PAL code number three confirmed. PAL code entry complete... Detonation code activated."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No! Why!"},{"character":"Computer","line":"Ready for launch..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake recieves a Codec call from Master Miller.)"},{"character":"Master","line":"Thank you Snake.  Now the detonation code is completed. Nothing can stop Metal Gear now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Master, what's going on?"},{"character":"Master","line":"You found the key and even activated the warhead for us too. I really must express my gratitude.  Sorry to have involved you in that silly shape memory alloy business.  We weren't able to learn the DARPA Chief's code.  Even with Mantis' psychic powers, he couldn't read his mind.  Then Ocelot accidentally killed him during the interrogation.  In other words, we weren't able to launch the nuclear device and we were all getting a little worried.  Without the threat of a nuclear strike, our demands would never be met."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you mean?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Without the detonation codes, we had to find some other way. That's when we decided...you might prove useful, Snake.  First I thought we might get the information from you, Snake.  So I had Decoy Octopus disguise himself as the DARPA Chief.  Unfortunately Octopus didn't survive the encounter. ...thanks to FoxDie."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean you had this planned from the beginning? Just to get me to input the detonation code!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Huh? You didn't think you made it this far by yourself, did you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who the hell are you!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"In any case, the launch preparations are complete.  Once the world glimpses the power of this weapon, the White House will have no choice but to surrender the FoxDie vaccine to me. Their ace-in-the- hole is useless now..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Ace-in-the-hole?"},{"character":"Master","line":"The Pentagon's plan to use you was already successful... in the torture room."},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake, you're the only one who doesn't know.  Poor fool."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who are you anyway!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I'll tell you everything you want to know.

He's been dead for at least three days.  I didn't know because my Codec link with Master was cut off.  But Mei Ling said his transmission signal was coming from inside the base!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"So who is it?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, you've been talking to..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"...Me... dear brother."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid!?

Pleasure to meet you"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Don't worry this injection won't hurt a bit."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the shot for?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"What's wrong? You don't like shots?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake listen up. It all went down five hours ago. Heavily armed soliders occupied Shadow Moses Island, a remote island off the coast of Alaska."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What soldiers?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Next-Generation Special Forces led by members of unit FOX-HOUND. They've presented Washington with a single demand, and they say that if it isn't met, they'll launch a nuclear weapon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A nuclear weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. You see, the island is the site of a secret nuclear weapons disposal facility."},{"character":"Snake","line":"FOX-HOUND hijacking a nuclear weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Now you understand how serious the situation is. You'll have two mission objectives. First, you're to rescue the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Chief, Donald Anderson, and the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker. They're both being held as hostages."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Those are some heavy duty hostages."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Secondly, you're to investigate whether or not the terrorists have the ability to launch a nuclear strike, and stop them if they do. Any questions, Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Questions? I haven't even said whether I'd accept this mission."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well you can make up your mind after you hear more about the situation."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about the nuclear weapons disposal facility."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The disposal facility includes a hardened underground base. Even with our most advanced intelligence gathering equipment, we can't tell what's happening inside."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So someone needs to penetrate, gather intelligence, and report back... Sounds like a spy movie. What's the insertion method?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well an air insertion is impossible."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Not with this storm going on."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll approach the disposal facility by sub."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Approach?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, within a few miles of it. The facility is equipped with sonar detection capability. They'd be able to hear our engine or propeller noise."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And then?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll launch a one-man SDV (swimmer delivery vehicle)."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Launch?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Same as a torpedo. Only this has no propulsion device of its own. After the SDV gets as close as it can, dispose of it. From there on you'll have to swim."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You want me to swim in sub-zero Alaskan water?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry. That suit represents the latest advances in poly- thermal technology. The nuclear weapons disposal facility covers the whole island. I'll contact you by Codec after you reach your target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Anyone going with me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"As usual, this is a one-man inflitration mission."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Weapons and equipment OSP (on-site procurement)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. This a top-secret black op. Don't expect any official support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Chief of DARPA and the president of an arms manufacturing company... what business did they have at a nuclear weapons disposal facility?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The truth is that secret exercises were being conducted at the time the terrorist group attacked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Must be extremely important exercises if those two were directly involved. Were they testing some kind of new advanced weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not privy to that information."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do we know exactly where they're being held?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The DARPA chief has also been injected with a mini-transmitter. As you get closer you should be able to pick up his location on your radar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do they really have the ability to launch a nuclear missile?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They say they do. They even gave us the serial number of the warhead they plan to use."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was the number confirmed?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. At the very least, they've got their hands on a real nuclear warhead."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Isn't there some kind of safety device to prevent this kind of terrorism?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. Every missile and warhead in our arsenal is equipped with a PAL, which uses a discreet detonation code."},{"character":"Snake","line":"PAL?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Permissive Action Link. A safety control system built into all nuclear weapons systems. But even so, we can't rest easy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why not?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because the DARPA Chief knows the detonation code."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But even if they have a nuclear warhead, it must've been removed from its missile. All the missiles on these disposal sites are supposed to be dismantled. It's not that easy to get your hands on an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missle)."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That used to be true, but since the end of the Cold War you can get anything if you have enough money and the right connections."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So what exactly are they demanding?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"A person's remains."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Remains?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's right. To be more accurate, cell specimens which contain the individual's genomic information."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Cell specimens? Why would they want that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The terrorists need them. You see these Next-Generation Special Forces have been strengthened through gene therapy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Strengthened?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You've heard of the Human Genome Project. They've been mapping the human genome, and they're nearly finished. Following up on this research, the military has been working towards identifiying those genes which are responsible for making effective soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There are genes that do that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and using gene therapy they're able to transplant those genes into regular soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Gene therapy?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I'll explain this part. With gene therapy, we can remove those genes which we know may lead to sickness or disease, and that the same time, splice in genes with beneficial effects such as resistance to cancer for example."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"In other words, we can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases and at the same time add genetic characteristics as desired."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, and so if you knew what genes were responsible for making the perfect soldier, you could implant them in the same way, right?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes we could."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But it all depends on being able to isolate and identify those \"soldier genes\"."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And in order to do that, it's helpful to study the genomic information of one of the greatest soldiers ever."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One of the greatest soldiers ever?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The man they call the greatest warrior of the twentieth century."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You don't mean Big Boss?!"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right. We've been working feverishly to identify the genes responsible for his incredible combat skill. So far we've discovered about sixty of the so-called \"soldier genes.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"So his body was recovered after all."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and his cells have remained frozen in cryo-chamber. His genomic information is a priceless treasure to mankind."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Priceless to the military perhaps."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"His body was burned severely, but it was possible to restore his DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) profile from just a single strand of his hair."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You people are amazing. And then you're going to transplant those genes into soldiers?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. We'll use a process that I discovered called gene targeting. The strongest soldiers don't become what they are by acquiring their skills through training or experience, we now know that hereditary factors are far more crucial for creating superior soldiers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, we can't give them his body. It's potentially more dangerous than all the warheads on that island put together."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I hear the terrorists are calling themselves the \"Sons of Big Boss.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the time limit?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"24 hours. They say they'll launch after 24 hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did they say what the target will be?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"So far they haven't mentioned a target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"When did the countdown start?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"5 hours ago."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, who are you speaking for?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Naturally, I'm representing the US government."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So who's in supervisory control of this operation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The President of the United States."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Which means that the President must be meeting with his top aides in the map room about now, huh?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No at this point they're still video conferencing with each other."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If that's a real nuclear warhead, shouldn't they issue a COG (Continuity of Government)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Not yet. The Secretary of Defense has operational control and is fully aware of the situation. After you infiltrate, if you determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities a COG will be issued."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well if they haven't relocated to nuclear shelter under Mount Washingtion, I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet. Is the National Security Agency in on this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. So is the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The DIA? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They'll be sending us some support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We don't need desk jockies. We need a nuclear weapons specialist."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Of course. A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned to us."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We need backup from a specialist. I'm just an amateur when it comes to nuclear weapons."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I know. That's why I've requested the assistance of a military analyst named Nastasha Romanenko. She'll be providing you backup by Codec."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female analyst?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's built up an impressive record as an advisor to the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Contact her if you have any questions. She's also an expert on hi-tech weapons."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where's she working from?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"At her home in Los Angeles."},{"character":"Snake","line":"California. Seems like a million miles away."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How well-armed are these terrorists? I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They're heavily armed I'm afraid."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about they're battle experience."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The six members of FOX-HOUND in charge are all hardened veterans. They're tough enough to eat nails and ask for seconds."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The others are Next-Generation Special Forces. They're not your average grunts either."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They started out as an anti-terrorist special-ops unit made up of members from former biochem units, technical escort units, and the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Their purpose was to respond to threats involving next-generation weapons of mass destruction, including NBC (nuclear/biological/chemica) weapons."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Until \"they\" were added that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's \"they\"?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"These guys didn't start out as regular army."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a pretty international group. Mercenaries?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yeah. And it gets worse. Most of them were from a merc agency that I think you're familiar with. They were part of Big Boss' private guard. And after Big Boss went down, the military just bought out all their contracts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Outer Heaven."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"After that they were merged with our own VR unit, Force 21, and re-trained. If you ask me, these so-called \"Next-Generation Special Forces\" should to be called \"simulated soldiers.\" They have no real battle experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Video game players, huh?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy. They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers. Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by international law."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes, but those are just declarations not actual treaties."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit conspired in this attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"They're calling it a revolution."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Since they all went through the same gene therapy, they probably felt closer than brothers. They see the unit as their only family."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss. But if they were regular army, they must've been interviewed periodically by army counsellers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"According to their files, they all got straight A's on their psychological tests. They all seemed like fine, upstanding patriotic soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But they all took part in the uprising?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No. Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise. That's why there was a resupply of troops."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Apparently they consulted classified information about the soldier genes and performed their own gene therapy experiments."},{"character":"Snake","line":"They can do that even without you?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well our gene therapy process is almost completely automated. And besides that they're all geniuses with IQs over 180."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Even the existence of this genome army is a national secret of the highest order. We'd been hoping to investigate this quietly and deal with it behind closed doors."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Hi-Tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND. Your former unit, and one that I was a commander of. An elite group combining firepower and expertise. They're every bit as good as when I was commanding them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they're still around."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are six members of FOX-HOUND involved in this terrorist activity. Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities. Sniper Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter. Decoy Octopus, master of disguise. Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman. And Revolver Ocelot, specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a lovely bunch of folks. Too bad we'll be meeting under these circumstances."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"And finally, in charge of them, FOX-HOUND's squad leader Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake?!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes and you're the only person who can stand against him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Liquid Snake. The man with the same codename as you."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me what you know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager, the youngest person in the SAS (British Special Air Service).  His job was to track down and destroy mobile SCUD missile launching platforms. You were there too I believe. Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was just a kid myself back then."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The details are classified, but it seems that originally he penetrated the the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS."},{"character":"Snake","line":"He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But he never once showed his face in Century House. He was taken prisoner in Iraq, and after that there was no trace of him for several years. After you retired, he was rescued and became a member of FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using codenames."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know his real name. That information is so highly classified that even I can't look at it. Here's a photo of him.  Pretty shocking, huh?  His skin tone is a little different but otherwise you two are exact duplicates."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have a twin?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know the details, but it seems so. That's why we really need you for this mission."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're the only one who can beat him. Now that I've met you, I know. You've got something he doesn't. I can see it in your eyes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why don't I find that thought more comforting?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore. Let me go back to Twin Lakes."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Why Snake? Is your life in Alaska all that great?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's a dogsled race this week.

Blackmail."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No Snake. I prefer to look at it as helping you to come to a decision more easily. But anyway, I know you better than that. You'd take this assignment even without the threat."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why do you say that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You're a natural born soldier. You're not the grow old gracefully type. Same for all of us who've seen real action. The only place we can feel truly alive is on the battlefield. I'm a solider too.

I'm a scientist."},{"character":"Snake","line":"By the way, what was that injection for?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It's a combination of and nanomachines and an anti-freezing peptide so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze, even at sub-arctic temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nanomachines?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Not just one kind either. There are different types which will replenish the supply of adrenaline, nutrition and sugar in your bloodstream."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Now I don't have to worry about food."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I also put some nootropics in there."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Say what?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Nootropics.

Colonel, can you hear me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Loud and clear Snake.  What's the situation?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Just as I expected.  You'll have to take the elevator to the surface.  But make sure that nobody sees you.  If you need to contact me by codec, the frequency is 140.85.

It's designed to prevent hypothermia.  This is Alaska you know."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Take it easy, I'm grateful.  If it wasn't for your suit and your shot I would have turned into a popsicle out there."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"An anti-freezing peptide Snake.  All of the Genome soldiers in this exercise are using it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm relieved to hear that.  Already tested, huh?  By the way, how's the diversionary operation going?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.

This is Mei Ling.  She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist. She designed your codec, as well as your Soliton radar system.

Don't forget it."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Remember, except for your binoculars you're naked.  You need to arm yourself with whatever weapons you can find."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember.  First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here, and then all my weapons are taken away.  Imagine yourself put in that position."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well, if yck in one you make it back in one piece, maybe I'll let you do a strip search on me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll hold you to that doctor.  By the way, sorry to dissapoint you but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How did you do that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"In my stomach.  Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach acids."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Cigarettes?  How are those going to help you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You never know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"If you want to get in, there's the front door."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake pulls out his binoculars and takes a look.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"It's the fastest way, but there's too much risk of being spotted by the enemy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't just knock on the door and ask them to let me in.

What are you doing here?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some peace and quiet.  I'm in retirement just like you.  Once in a while I still help train the Alaskan Scouts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Campbell told me about the situation here.  I thought I might be of some use."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you."},{"character":"Master","line":"Well, I know lots about survival in a harsh environment.

We were conducting excercises of a new type of experimental weapon. A weapon that will change the world."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"A weapon with the ability to launch a nuclear attack from any place on the face of the earth.

Baker knows one and I know one."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Baker?  The president of ArmsTech?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"That's right.

You... you're from the Pentagon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Answer my question!  What about your code!?  There's no time!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I... talked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What! Now the terrorists have both codes and can launch anytime!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"It's not like I didn't fight.

How'd you do it?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Surgical implants in my brain."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Surgical implants?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Kind of like a psychic insulation.

He had a heart attack or something."},{"character":"Baker","line":"A heart attack? Oh, don't be a fool."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Anyway, the terrorists have both codes now."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Those boys are totally insane.  They wouldn't hesitate to launch."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I agree.  But what do they really want?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Who knows.  Maybe they're like us in the arms industry... always looking forward to the next good war."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well I'm not going to let these maniacs start a war toady.  Do you still have the card keys."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Card keys?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"To override tge detonation codes!

Not the terrorists!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"No, that woman."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Woman!?  Who!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"A soldier that was thrown in prison along with me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female soldier?  It must be..."},{"character":"Baker","line":"She said that she had just joined up as a new recruit.  She said they threw her in prison because she refused to take part in the rebellion."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A new recruit?  Could that be the Colonel's niece!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I gave her the key.  Looks like she managed to break out of here though. I hope she's okay."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sure she is.  She's green... but as tough as they come.  But how did you know she escaped?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I was in contact with her by Codec.  Until I was tied up here that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Codec?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  She stole it from the guard.  If she still has it, you should be able to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sure she still has it.  What frequency was she at?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh yeah.  Let me tell you.  It's..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker is struggling to remember.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Huh?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...Oh... sorry... I forgot..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh that's right!  It should be on the back of the CD case.  Try to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll contact her right away.  But tell me... If this doesn't work, is there some other way to prevent the missile launch?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Hmmm.  You need to find Hal Emmerich, one of my employees."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The team leader of the Metal Gear Rex project.  A genius at engineering, but a little bit of an oddball.  If there is anyone who can figure out how to stop Metal Gear from launching, it's him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What if he can't come up with anything?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You'll have to destroy it.  Emmerich knows how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where is this Emmerich?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Well... he's probably being held somewhere in the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building.  It's north from here.  That's where he worked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, but... why Metal Gear?  The Nuclear Age ended with the turn of the millenium."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You're wrong.  The threat of nuclear war isn't gone... in fact it's greater than it's ever been."},{"character":"action","line":"(Scenes of missile launches, storage buildings, and missile silos are shown.)"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The amount of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium is increasing even today.  Listen, have you ever seen a warehouse full of nuclear material?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...No."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Drums and drums of nuclear waste stacked this high.  As far as you can see because there's still no real way to dispose of the stuff."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they just close the lid and pretend like it'll go away?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Essentially, yes.  And they're not even doing a good job of storing it.  Many of the drums are corroded... with nuclear waste seeping out of them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Unbelievable."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Not only that, several pounds of MUF are reported every year."},{"character":"Snake","line":"MUF?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"It stands for \"material unnacounted for\". It proves that there is a large and well organized black market in nuclear materials. Furthermore, since the end of the Cold War, Russian nuclear engineers, in particular, are out of work with nowhere to turn."},{"character":"action","line":"(We go back to the chamber where Snake and Baker are conversing.)"},{"character":"Baker","line":"In other words, there is plenty of nuclear material and scientists for making a bomb.  We live in an age when any small country can have a nuclear weapons program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about the other superpowers?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Russia and China still maintain a signifigant nuclear presence. Complete nuclear disarmament is an impossibility.  To maintain our own policy of deterrance, we need a weapon of overwhelming power."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean Metal Gear."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You know our industry suffered quite a blow as a result of the cut-backs in military budgets, due to this so called \"peace\"."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember hearing a lot about mergers and take-overs among the big weapons makers."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  And after my company lost their bid to produce the Air Force's next fighter jet, the Metal Gear project was out last ace in the hole.  That's why we pushed to have Metal Gear developed as a black project."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Black project?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Secret projects paid for by the Pentagon's black budget.  You can avoid a lot of red tape a get a great lead-time on your weapons production.  And no one can bother you.  Not even those bleeding heart liberals on the military oversight committee."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Bribes."},{"character":"Baker","line":"I prefer to think of it as good buisness.  Anyway, Metal Gear was going to be formally adopted after the results of this exercise were analyzed."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't give a crap about you and your company."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes, that's about what I'd expect from a grunt like you... Here, this is what you came for, right?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker fishes a disc out of his pocket and hands it to Snake.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"An optical disk.  It's all here.  The main hard drive was destroyed by gunfire.  This is the only remaining copy of the data."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What kind of data?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"All the data collected from this exercise.  Don't play dumb.  I know you were sent to get this.  I hid it from that sadistic maniac while he was torturing me.  They don't know that this disk exists. Make sure that you report this to Jim... to your boss.  I'll give you my card too.  It'll open up all level two security doors."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Can you walk?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...No ...You go on without me.  They got my password... they don't want anything else from me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have one more question.  Who or what was that ninja thing?  It looked like you knew something."},{"character":"Baker","line":"That ninja?  That was FOX-HOUND's dark little secret."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Dark little secret?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"An experimantal... genome... soldier..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker coughs once more.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You know him?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You should ask Dr. Naomi Hunter from FOX-HOUND.  She knows better than I."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You've got to stop them.  If it goes public, my company and I are... finished."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?  Doesn't Metal Gear use currently existing technology?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Metal Gear itself does, but..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker bends over in pain.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Huh!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"What... what did you do to me!?  Uh... oooh...no!  ...Ooh.  Oh no, it can't be! ...those Pentagon bastards!  ...So they...they actually went ahead and did it!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"They... they're just... using you for... uuuhhh..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker slumps over and Snake stands in front of him stunned and confused.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What the hell?"},{"character":"action","line":"(After thinking for a moment he calls Campbell on the Codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel!

Now he's dead too!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"...I have no idea!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't lie to me!"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It looked like another heart attcak but..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Some kind of poison!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well, there are a lot of drugs that can cause a heart attack in large doses.  For example. potassium chloride or dioxides... But... we won't be able to tell without doing an autopsy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I want you and Meryl to work together!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Can I trust her?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"...More than you can trust me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Get in contact with her."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Snake, there is a lot of electrical interferance coming from there.

Just exactly who are you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm the fool that your uncle sent all alone into the middle of this whole mess."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You came by yourself?  You think you're some kind of one-man army? You're not even armed."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I appreciate your help from before.  But... I don't need lectures.

You're not brothers are you!?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have no family."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"So, what's the deal then?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who knows.  Why don't you ask him?  But first I want some information.  You were involved in this excercise from the beginning. What exactly happened here?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I'm sorry.  I was captured along with President Baker right after the terrorist attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That's okay.  But what is this place?  I don't think it is just a nuclear wepaons disposal facility..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Boy oh boy... it's just like them!  Nobody told you anything, did they?  Okay... you see, this place isn't really for disposing nuclear weapons.  This base is owned and operated by a dummy corporation of ArmsTech."},{"character":"Snake","line":"This is a civilian base?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Right.  For the development of Metal Gear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel!"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"FOX-HOUND and the Next-Generation Special Forces were called here for the test launching of a dummy nuclear warhead."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why FOX-HOUND?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Because they're a Special Ops group used to handling top secret missions.  They figured they could keep it all hush-hush."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But we must have fired nuclear warheads before.  Why just this time?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I heard it was because this was to be a final test before the formal adoption of the Metal Gear program... that's what I heard anyway."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Hmmm... sounds kind of fishy...  So what do you think the terrorists want?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Sorry, I'm not sure.  I was captured with President Baker right after the revolt started."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh yeah, that's when he gave you the detonation override keys, right?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"That's right."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Amazing you were able to keep 'em hidden from the guards."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Well... women have more hiding places than men.  Anyway, you met up with Baker, huh?  How's he holding up?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"He's dead..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"What!?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Heart attack.  Same as the DARPA Chief."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"The Chief died from a heart attck too?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah, was either of them sick or anything?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"No, not that I heard of."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well, I don't believe in coincidences.  Something funny's going on."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Hmmm.  Sounds like it. But I have no idea what."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Me neither... yet.  Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You mean Dr. emmerich?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yes.  Is he still alive?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Probably.  he should be in the second floor basemant of the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building to the north."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Second floor basement?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Yeah, that's where his lab is.  I think they're forcing him to work on the nuclear launching program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Then we'd better do something before he finishes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're right.  In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You plan to take that thing on by yourself, Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It won't be the first time..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"........."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the best way to get to the building where the Doctor is being held?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"There's a cargo door on the first floor of this building that leads to the north."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the security level of the door there?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Five, but it's okay...

You wanna quit?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I can't quit.  I can't alow myself to quit now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Listen, Meryl.  Everybody feels sick the first time they kill someone.  Unfortunately, killing is one of those things that gets easier the more you do it.  In a war, all of mankind's worst emotions, worst traits come out.

It's a terrorist action."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're just a little jumpy from the combat high.  The adrenaline in your blood is starting to whin out.

For now, just think about keeping yourself alive."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"If I get out of here alive, I'll think about that other stuff."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, let me try to say this another way... Stay the hell out of my way."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You're a real bastard, just like my uncle said."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Ha ha, I told you.  The real me is no match for the legend."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"It looks like you were right.  Okay Snake, I'll be a good girl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We'll link up after I grab the Doctor.  Then we'll take care of the detonation code override."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Got ya.

You better hurry. If they were planning a launch from the start, then their ballistic program is probably finished.  And since they haven't called for me in a few hours, they must not need me.  In other words, they must be ready to launch."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Meryl's got the detonation override keys.

That's the reason for the deadline."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right, Snake.  And that's why we can't let the terrorist attack go public."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We still haven't even ratified Start 2 or dealt with the issue of TMDs.

That's all I know."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And you were able to kill him, knowing that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yup."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"He wanted it.

We did.  In Zanzibar.  But it was nothing personal. We were just proffesionals on opposite sides, that's all."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And you still call yourselves friends?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Hard to believe?  War is no reason to end a friendship."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's insane."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I first met him on the battlefield.  He was being held a prisoner of Outer Heaven.

I was still green and he showed me the ropes."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You knew him well?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No.  We never talked about our personal lives.  Sort of an unwritten rule.  The nest time I saw him on the battlefield, we were enemies.  We were fighting barehanded in a minefield.  I know it sounds strange to most people.

We are animals."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"So if you were friends, then how do you explain the Ninja's behavior?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't know."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It's your genes... they make you predisposed towards violence!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You really like talking about genes, Naomi.  Why did you get into genetic research anyway?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I never knew who my parents were or even what they looked like. I guess I got into genetics because I wanted to figure out why I'm the way I am."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So you studied about DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yeah.  I thought if I studied my genetic structure, I'd find out who I really was.  I thought that by analyzing a person's genetic information, I could retrieve the blank spots in that person's memory."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Memory is stored in DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"We're not sure.  But we know that a person's genetic fate is determined just by the sequence of the four bases in their DNA."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So what about my fate? You know my DNA sequence, don't you?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Your fate?  I...I'm sorry.  I have no idea."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Of course not.

Just as I thought, the nuclear warhead is designed to be fired from the rail gun, like a projectile... It doesn't use fuel so it isn't considered a missile. That way it can get around all sorts of international treaties."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Pretty sneaky."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yes, but effective.  And that's not even the scariest thing about this weapon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't wait to hear this."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"It's a stealth weapon!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean it won't show up on radar?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah.  The truth is... they've been working on a stealth missile since the late 70's."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why weren't they able to develope one until now?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Because of the missile's rocket propulsion system... it will be picked up by enemy satellites."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh yeah, that makes sense."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"But unlike a missile, the rail gun doesn't burn any propellant.  So it can't be detected by any current ballistic missile detection systems."},{"character":"Snake","line":"An invisible nuclear warhead..."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Totally impossible to intercept.  And on top of that, it's got a surface piercing warhead designed to penetrate hardened underground bases."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We learned that lesson in the Gulf War."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"This thing could mean the end of the world!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It's the ultimate weapon.  And from a political point of view, it avoids the problem of nuclear reduction and nuclear inspections. Colonel, is this true?  Are you listening?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm listening..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If word of this got out, it could delay the signing of the Start 3 Treaty and cause a huge international incident."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah, it would be nasty.  The United States would be denounced by the UN... it could even bring the President down..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did you know this, Colonel?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You've changed, Colonel."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I won't make any excuses..."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Snake, listen to me.  This new nuclear weapon... it's never actually been tested, only simulated."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean they ran a computer model?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah, that's why they were conducting this excercise.  They needed to get actual data to back up the simulation."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What were the results of the excercise?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"It looks like it went better than they hoped for.  But...I can't find the data anywhere on this network.  You'd think that data as important as that would be carefully recorded..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"It was.  President Baker gave me an optical disc with all of the test data."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"What!? Do you still have it?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, Ocelot took it from me."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Damn..."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"The terrorists have replaced the dummy warhead with a real warhead. Once they input the detonation codes, they should be ready to launch."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So you think they can do it?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Well the dummy warhead was designed to be identical to the real thing, so I think so."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did you find out how to override it yet?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Not yet.  It must be in a separate file.  Right now, I'm looking through all of Baker's personal files."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We're counting on you..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake enters the control center of the Rex hangar.  He sees Liquid and Ocelot talking.)"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Okay. I've entered the PAL codes and disengaged the safety device. We can launch anytime."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"There's still no response from Washington. It looks like we'll have to show them that we mean business."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Should I set it for Chernoton, Russia?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"No, there's been a change. The new target is...Lopnor, China."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Why Boss?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"I'm sure neither you nor Mr. Gurlukovich would really like to see a nuclear bomb dropped on your Motherland, right?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid!"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"But why? There's nothing there."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Wrong. It's a nuclear test site."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"A nuclear test site?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"If we nuke a major population center, the game's over... But a nuclear explosion at a test site can still be concealed from the public. Meanwhile Washington will be worried about the retaliatory strike from China."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"That'll probably mean top secret talks between both countries' leaders..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Of course. And in the process, the President will be forced to divulge the existence of a new and highly destabilizing nuclear weapon to the Chinese. What do you think that will do to the U.S.'s reputation? Or the President's?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"And with the CTBT, that means that China and India... I see..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Yes. When the other countries hear about this new weapon, they'll all want to contact us. Washington won't be very happy when we start selling their own system to the highest bidders. Yes. The President will break. He will give in to our demands."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Big Boss's DNA and one billion dollars..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One billion dollars!"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"That money will be used to cure our genome soldiers as well. I'm also including the FoxDie vaccine in our demands."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"FoxDie... It killed Octopus and the ArmsTech president... So it's true that it affects older people first. Mantis might not have been affected because he wore a mask."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Wolf wasn't infected either. Perhaps due to those tranquilizers she always took."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Something to do with the adrenaline level in the blood? Or maybe it's just because this FoxDie was still experimental and they haven't worked out all the bugs yet..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"In any case, have you heard from your friend, Colonel Sergei Gurlukovich at the Spetznaz?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"He still has doubts about the ability of Metal Gear. He said we can talk after Metal Gear's test launch is successful."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"He is a very prudent man."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"There's nothing to worry about. The Colonel wants Metal Gear and the new nuclear weapon so bad he can taste it. If Russia wants to regain its position as a military superpower, they need to reinforce their nuclear arsenal. They need a nuclear weapon that can't be intercepted. Metal Gear will allow them to gain first strike capability over the rest of the world."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Their regular army is in shambles and they think they can restore their country's military power with nuclear weapons? Gurlukovich... he's no warrior... he is a politician."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"But he's the one who gave us the Hind and most of our other heavy firepower."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"He's got over a thousand soldiers under his command. If we joined forces we could put up quite a resistance here. Since Mantis died, the genome soldiers' brainwashing has started to wear off. I'm worried about the men's morale. An alliance with the Russians would boost that as well..."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"What are you saying?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"We're not going anywhere. We're going to dig in here."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"We could still escape..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"We've got the most powerful weapon ever made and we're about to ally with Gurlukovich's forces."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Are you going to fight the whole world?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"And what's wrong with that? We can launch a nuclear warhead at any target on this planet... A nuclear warhead invisible to radar. And on top of that, this base is full of spare nuclear warheads. Once we get the DNA and the money, the world will be ours!"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"What about your promise to Colonel Gurlukovich?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"I have no interest in the revival of Mother Russia."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"...You're not thinking of reviving Big Boss's dream?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"From today, ...call this place \"Outer Heaven\"."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Big Boss's dream..."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"But Boss,... you're not worried about the PAL being overridden? If the code is entered again, it'll be deactivated."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"No need to worry. The DARPA Chief and the ArmsTech president are both dead."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Does Snake know how the override system works?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"You interrogated him. Don't you know?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"He didn't have any keys on him."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Good. Then no one can stop Metal Gear now."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"By the way, what should we do with that woman? Want me to kill her?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Let her live. She's Campbell's niece and Snake cares for her... We'll keep her as our ace in-the-hole."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Meryl... she's alive."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Snake, I found Baker's top-secret files!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Great job."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"How's it going there?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"They've finished inputting the PAL codes. So how do we deactivate them?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Okay...y'see the override system that the president was talking about... It can also be used to input the detonation codes. Y'see if you insert the keys when the warhead is active, you deactivate it. And if you insert them when it's inactive, it becomes activated. And you can only use the keys once."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Only once, huh."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah...you'd better get started. We don't have much time."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But it takes three keys, right!? I've only got one of them!"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Hold on a minute. Y'see that's the trick. You already have all three keys!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"The card key is made of a shape memory alloy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Shape memory alloy?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yes. It's a material that changes shape at different temperatures. The key is made out of it!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"This card key?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah. The card key changes shape at different temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So this key is actually three keys in one...clever."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Can you see the input terminals in the center of the Control Room..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I see them."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Those three laptop terminals are for the emergency input. There should be a symbol on each screen... Each symbol corresponds to a different key. Input the keys in order from left to right. The left one's for the room temperature key. See the symbol? Next to that goes the low temperature key. The one on the right is the high temperature key."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, I got it. First I change the shape of the card and then I input them in order, right?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"That's right. All you do is insert the card keys.

I'm sure of it..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...Fox...no... Naomi, tell me something..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...about FoxDie?  FoxDie is a type of retrovirus that targets and kills only specific people.  First, it infects the macrophages in the victim's body.  FoxDie contains smart enzymes, created through protein engineering.  They're programmed to respond to specific genetic patterns in the cells."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Those enzymes recognize the target's DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Right. They respond by becoming active, and using the macrophages, they begin creating TNF epsilon.  It's a type of cytokine, a peptide which causes cells to die.  The TNF epsilon is carried along the bloodstream to the heart, where they attach to the TNF receptors in the heart cells."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And then...they cause a heart attack?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The heart cells suffer a shock and undergo an extreme apoptosis. Then... the victim dies."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Apoptosis...you mean the heart cells commit suicide... Naomi..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...What?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...You must have programmed that thing to kill me too, right? Do I still have time? Naomi, I don't blame you for wanting me dead.  But I can't go yet. I still have a job to do."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Listen, Snake.  I'm not the one who made the decision to use FoxDie."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You weren't?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You were injected with FoxDie as a part of this operation.

Now the detonation code is completed. Nothing can stop Metal Gear now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Master, what's going on?"},{"character":"Master","line":"You found the key and even activated the warhead for us too. I really must express my gratitude.  Sorry to have involved you in that silly shape memory alloy business.  We weren't able to learn the DARPA Chief's code.  Even with Mantis' psychic powers, he couldn't read his mind.  Then Ocelot accidentally killed him during the interrogation.  In other words, we weren't able to launch the nuclear device and we were all getting a little worried.  Without the threat of a nuclear strike, our demands would never be met."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you mean?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Without the detonation codes, we had to find some other way. That's when we decided...you might prove useful, Snake.  First I thought we might get the information from you, Snake.  So I had Decoy Octopus disguise himself as the DARPA Chief.  Unfortunately Octopus didn't survive the encounter. ...thanks to FoxDie."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean you had this planned from the beginning? Just to get me to input the detonation code!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Huh? You didn't think you made it this far by yourself, did you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who the hell are you!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"In any case, the launch preparations are complete.

And you performed quite well I must say. Although the boys at the Pentagon are probably saying the same thing..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What the hell are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Following orders blindly with no questions asked. You've lost your warrior's pride and become nothing more than a pawn, Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Stopping the nuclear launch, rescuing the hostages... It was all just a diversion."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A diversion?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"The Pentagon only needed for you to come into contact with us. That's what killed the ArmsTech president and Decoy Octopus."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You don't mean..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"That's right. You were sent in here to kill us so they could retrieve Metal Gear undamaged along with the bodies of the genome soldiers. From the beginning, the Pentagon was just using you as a vector to spread FoxDie!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Fox Die! ...It can't be! Are you telling me Naomi was working with the Pentagon?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"They thought she was. But it seems that Dr. Naomi Hunter couldn't be controlled so easily."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"We've got a spy working in the Pentagon. He reported that Dr. Hunter altered FoxDie's program just before the operation. But...no one knows how or why."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I wonder... maybe they arrested her so they could find out the answer to that."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"No doubt. But I had no idea she was motivated by such petty revenge... we still don't know what changes she made to FoxDie's program. Oh well. It doesn't matter. I've already added the FoxDie vaccine to my list of White House demands."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's a vaccine?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"There must be. But that woman is the only one who really knows. Anyway, it might prove to be unnecessary."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why is that?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"You were successful in coming into contact with all of us, so we must have all been exposed to the virus. It's true that the ArmsTech president and Decoy Octopus were killed by FoxDie... But Ocelot, myself, and you, the carrier, were apparently unaffected."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A bug in the virus' programming?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Hmm, could be. In any case, if it doesn't kill you then I'm not worried either. After all, our genetic code is identical."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So it's true...you and I are..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Yes, twins, but we're not ordinary twins... we're twins linked by cursed genes. Les enfants terribles. You're fine. You got all the old man's dominant genes. I got all the flawed, recessive genes. Everything was done so that you would be the greatest of his children. The only reason I exist is so they could create you."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was the favorite, huh."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"That's right! I'm just the leftovers of what they used to make you. Can you understand what it's like to know that you're garbage since the day you were born!?

He always told me I was inferior and now I'll have my revenge!! You should understand me, brother. You killed our father with your own hands! You stole my chance for revenge! Now I'll finish the work that father began. I will surpass him... I will destroy him!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're just like Naomi."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Well I'm not like you.

Following up on this research, the military has been working towards identifiying those genes which are responsible for making effective soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There are genes that do that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and using gene therapy they're able to transplant those genes into regular soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Gene therapy?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I'll explain this part. With gene therapy, we can remove those genes which we know may lead to sickness or disease, and that the same time, splice in genes with beneficial effects such as resistance to cancer for example."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"In other words, we can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases and at the same time add genetic characteristics as desired."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, and so if you knew what genes were responsible for making the perfect soldier, you could implant them in the same way, right?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes we could."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But it all depends on being able to isolate and identify those \"soldier genes\"."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And in order to do that, it's helpful to study the genomic information of one of the greatest soldiers ever."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One of the greatest soldiers ever?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The man they call the greatest warrior of the twentieth century."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You don't mean Big Boss?!"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right. We've been working feverishly to identify the genes responsible for his incredible combat skill. So far we've discovered about sixty of the so-called \"soldier genes.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"So his body was recovered after all."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and his cells have remained frozen in cryo-chamber. His genomic information is a priceless treasure to mankind."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Priceless to the military perhaps."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"His body was burned severely, but it was possible to restore his DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) profile from just a single strand of his hair."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You people are amazing. And then you're going to transplant those genes into soldiers?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. We'll use a process that I discovered called gene targeting. The strongest soldiers don't become what they are by acquiring their skills through training or experience, we now know that hereditary factors are far more crucial for creating superior soldiers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, we can't give them his body. It's potentially more dangerous than all the warheads on that island put together."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I hear the terrorists are calling themselves the \"Sons of Big Boss.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the time limit?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"24 hours. They say they'll launch after 24 hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did they say what the target will be?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"So far they haven't mentioned a target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"When did the countdown start?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"5 hours ago."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, who are you speaking for?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Naturally, I'm representing the US government."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So who's in supervisory control of this operation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The President of the United States."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Which means that the President must be meeting with his top aides in the map room about now, huh?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No at this point they're still video conferencing with each other."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If that's a real nuclear warhead, shouldn't they issue a COG (Continuity of Government)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Not yet. The Secretary of Defense has operational control and is fully aware of the situation. After you infiltrate, if you determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities a COG will be issued."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well if they haven't relocated to nuclear shelter under Mount Washingtion, I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet. Is the National Security Agency in on this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. So is the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The DIA? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They'll be sending us some support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We don't need desk jockies. We need a nuclear weapons specialist."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Of course. A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned to us."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We need backup from a specialist. I'm just an amateur when it comes to nuclear weapons."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I know. That's why I've requested the assistance of a military analyst named Nastasha Romanenko. She'll be providing you backup by Codec."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female analyst?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's built up an impressive record as an advisor to the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Contact her if you have any questions. She's also an expert on hi-tech weapons."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where's she working from?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"At her home in Los Angeles."},{"character":"Snake","line":"California. Seems like a million miles away."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How well-armed are these terrorists? I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They're heavily armed I'm afraid."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about they're battle experience."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The six members of FOX-HOUND in charge are all hardened veterans. They're tough enough to eat nails and ask for seconds."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The others are Next-Generation Special Forces. They're not your average grunts either."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They started out as an anti-terrorist special-ops unit made up of members from former biochem units, technical escort units, and the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Their purpose was to respond to threats involving next-generation weapons of mass destruction, including NBC (nuclear/biological/chemica) weapons."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Until \"they\" were added that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's \"they\"?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"These guys didn't start out as regular army."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a pretty international group. Mercenaries?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yeah. And it gets worse. Most of them were from a merc agency that I think you're familiar with. They were part of Big Boss' private guard. And after Big Boss went down, the military just bought out all their contracts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Outer Heaven."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"After that they were merged with our own VR unit, Force 21, and re-trained. If you ask me, these so-called \"Next-Generation Special Forces\" should to be called \"simulated soldiers.\" They have no real battle experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Video game players, huh?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy. They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers. Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by international law."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes, but those are just declarations not actual treaties."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit conspired in this attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"They're calling it a revolution."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Since they all went through the same gene therapy, they probably felt closer than brothers. They see the unit as their only family."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss. But if they were regular army, they must've been interviewed periodically by army counsellers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"According to their files, they all got straight A's on their psychological tests. They all seemed like fine, upstanding patriotic soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But they all took part in the uprising?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No. Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise. That's why there was a resupply of troops."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Apparently they consulted classified information about the soldier genes and performed their own gene therapy experiments."},{"character":"Snake","line":"They can do that even without you?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well our gene therapy process is almost completely automated. And besides that they're all geniuses with IQs over 180."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Even the existence of this genome army is a national secret of the highest order. We'd been hoping to investigate this quietly and deal with it behind closed doors."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Hi-Tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND. Your former unit, and one that I was a commander of. An elite group combining firepower and expertise. They're every bit as good as when I was commanding them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they're still around."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are six members of FOX-HOUND involved in this terrorist activity. Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities. Sniper Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter. Decoy Octopus, master of disguise. Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman. And Revolver Ocelot, specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a lovely bunch of folks. Too bad we'll be meeting under these circumstances."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"And finally, in charge of them, FOX-HOUND's squad leader Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake?!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes and you're the only person who can stand against him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Liquid Snake. The man with the same codename as you."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me what you know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager, the youngest person in the SAS (British Special Air Service).  His job was to track down and destroy mobile SCUD missile launching platforms. You were there too I believe. Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was just a kid myself back then."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The details are classified, but it seems that originally he penetrated the the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS."},{"character":"Snake","line":"He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But he never once showed his face in Century House. He was taken prisoner in Iraq, and after that there was no trace of him for several years. After you retired, he was rescued and became a member of FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using codenames."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know his real name. That information is so highly classified that even I can't look at it. Here's a photo of him.  Pretty shocking, huh?  His skin tone is a little different but otherwise you two are exact duplicates."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have a twin?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know the details, but it seems so. That's why we really need you for this mission."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're the only one who can beat him. Now that I've met you, I know. You've got something he doesn't. I can see it in your eyes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why don't I find that thought more comforting?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore. Let me go back to Twin Lakes."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Why Snake? Is your life in Alaska all that great?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's a dogsled race this week. Next Saturday I have to be in Anchorage."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The Iditarod? The longest sled race in the world? When did you become a dog musher?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Right now my fifty huskies are my only family. I've got to take care of them."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry about your dogs."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you mean?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry Snake but this vessel is headed for the Bering Sea. There's no room for debate."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I told you, even if I do owe you I don't anything to this army or this country!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You will accept this assignment!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why should I be stupid enough to do that? I'm no patriot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, there's enough dirt in your file from your days as an agent to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh I see. Blackmail."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No Snake. I prefer to look at it as helping you to come to a decision more easily. But anyway, I know you better than that. You'd take this assignment even without the threat."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why do you say that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You're a natural born soldier. You're not the grow old gracefully type. Same for all of us who've seen real action. The only place we can feel truly alive is on the battlefield. I'm a solider too. I know those feelings of powerlessness, frustration that you feel everyday. You've tried to play the boy scout out there in Alaska, but you can't race dogs in the snow forever.  Why don't you come back to us and be a soldier again."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You think my life is some kind of joke?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I just want to give you back your purpose in life."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're retired. Why are you involved in this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because there aren't many people who know FOX-HOUND as well as I do."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Is that really the only reason?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've been soldiering for a long time, I don't know anything else. I guess even though I'm getting a little old, I still love to be in the field."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're a lousy liar. Tell me the real reason."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Okay Snake. Sorry. I'll be frank. A person very dear to me is being held hostage."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who is it?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"My niece. Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What was your niece doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt. And my niece was one of those called in as an emergency replacement."},{"character":"Snake","line":"She looks like you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's my little brother's girl. He died in the Gulf War. Since then I've been watching after her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A personal motive, Colonel. That's not very soldierly."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm retired. I'm just an old man now. And I'm your friend."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Since when are we friends?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've thought of us as friends since the fall of Zanzibar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"With my personality I don't have too many friends."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's what I trust about you. It's what makes you human. Please Snake. Save my niece Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"All right, but I have two conditions."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Name them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One, no more secrets between us. I want complete disclosure at all times and two, I'll only accept orders from you, Colonel. No cutoffs involved okay?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Agreed. That's why I was called. But one thing."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not a colonel anymore. Just a retired old warhorse."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, Colonel."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That doctor. Is she part of this operation too?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She was in charge of FOX-HOUND's gene therapy. She knows more about those men than anyone else."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean you've seen them naked?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Make no mistake. I'm not a nurse. I'm a scientist."},{"character":"Snake","line":"By the way, what was that injection for?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It's a combination of and nanomachines and an anti-freezing peptide so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze, even at sub-arctic temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nanomachines?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Not just one kind either. There are different types which will replenish the supply of adrenaline, nutrition and sugar in your bloodstream."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Now I don't have to worry about food."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I also put some nootropics in there."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Say what?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Nootropics. It's a class of drugs which will help improve your mental functioning."},{"character":"Snake","line":"It'll make smarter huh? Anything else?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Benzedrine. It's a type of stimulant. It'll keep you alert and responsive for twelve straight hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That was quite a cocktail. Anything else in there?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Those nanomachines will also keep your Codec's batteries charged up."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're welcome."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I need to borrow your scissors."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"What are you going to do?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't worry. Just going to clean myself up a little."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Huh?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't want to be mistaken for the leader of the terrorists."},{"character":"action","line":""},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake swims through the lower dock of the disposal facility.  We see a man riding up the cargo elevator.)"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Stay alert!  He'll be through here, I know it.  I'm going to go swat down a couple of bothersome flies."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake removes his flippers and calls Campbell on the codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"This is Snake.  Colonel, can you hear me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Loud and clear Snake.  What's the situation?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Just as I expected.  You'll have to take the elevator to the surface.  But make sure that nobody sees you.  If you need to contact me by codec, the frequency is 140.85.  When you want to use the codec push the Select button. When we need to contact you the codec will beep.  When you hear that noise push the Select button. The codec directly stimulates the small bones of your ear, no one but you will be able to hear it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Got it, okay, I'm ready to go."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake takes off his scuba gear and watches the landscape slide by as the elevator ascends.  The title appears on the screen \"Metal Gear Solid\".  The elevator stops and Snake quickly runs out and looks for cover behind a storage crate.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It's Snake.  I'm in front of the disposal facility."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Excellent, Snake.  Age hasn't slowed you down one bit."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How's that Sneaking Suit working out?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm nice and dry, but it is a little hard to move."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Bear with it.  It's designed to prevent hypothermia.  This is Alaska you know."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Take it easy, I'm grateful.  If it wasn't for your suit and your shot I would have turned into a popsicle out there."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"An anti-freezing peptide Snake.  All of the Genome soldiers in this exercise are using it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm relieved to hear that.  Already tested, huh?  By the way, how's the diversionary operation going?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.  The terrorist's radar should have picked them up by now."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake peers out from behind the crate and sees a group of terrorists by a helicopter.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"A Hind D?  Colonel, what's a Russian gunship doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I have no idea...but it looks like our little diversion got their attention.  Now's your best chance to slip in unnoticed."},{"character":"action","line":"(The helicopter takes off, throwing snow in all directions, the guards on the ground shield their eyes as they follow it up into the sky.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are only 18 hours left until their deadline.  You've got to hurry."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Wow...you must be crazy to fly a Hind in this kind of weather."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Oh sorry, I haven't introduced you two yet.  This is Mei Ling.  She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist. She designed your codec, as well as your Soliton radar system. Contact her if you have any questions about either of them."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Nice to meet you Snake.  It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"What's wrong?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nothing...I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so...cute."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"You're just flattering me..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, I'm serious.  Now I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"C'mon, I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake... But I'm surprised, you're very frank for a trained killer."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting the man behind the legend...but first, let me explain about your Soliton radar system."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"The bright dot in the middle is you Snake.  The red dots are your enemies and the blue cone shape represents their field of vision."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Be careful Snake. The Genome soldiers have highly developed senses of hearing and vision due to their gene therapy.  Make sure you don't let them see you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"First I want you to infiltrate the disposal site and look for the DARPA Chief."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The DARPA Chief was injected with the same GPS transmitting nanomachines as you."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"He should appear on your radar as a green dot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Get whatever information you can from him about the terrorists.  If he's alive that is..."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Snake, your radar isn't affected by the weather, but if you're discovered by an enemy you won't be able to use it."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, it gets jammed easily I'm afraid."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Yes, it's all made from currently existing technology.  You won't be able to use it in an area with strong harmonic resonance.  So be careful."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll be monitoring your movements by radar... so contact us by Codec anytime  you want."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Got it.  I'll call if I'm feeling lonely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Seriously Snake.  We're here to back you up, so call if you need some information or advice."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"I'm also in charge of your mission data.  Contact me if you want me to record your current status.  My frequency is 140.96.  It's a dedicated frequency for saving data.  Don't forget it."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Remember, except for your binoculars you're naked.  You need to arm yourself with whatever weapons you can find."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember.  First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here, and then all my weapons are taken away.  Imagine yourself put in that position."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well, if yck in one you make it back in one piece, maybe I'll let you do a strip search on me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll hold you to that doctor.  By the way, sorry to dissapoint you but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How did you do that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"In my stomach.  Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach acids."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Cigarettes?  How are those going to help you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You never know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"If you want to get in, there's the front door."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake pulls out his binoculars and takes a look.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"It's the fastest way, but there's too much risk of being spotted by the enemy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't just knock on the door and ask them to let me in.  One sentry on the left and one on the right.  They're armed with \"five five sixers\" and pineapples..."},{"character":"action","line":"(As the guard on the right approaches Snake puts back his binoculars and hides behind the crate again.

I'm counting on you Snake."},{"character":"action","line":"(The game resumes and the player takes control.  Eventually, Snake enters the vent on the second floor of the facility, he gets a codec call from Master Miller, his old instructor.)"},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake, it's been a long time."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Master?  What are you doing here?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some peace and quiet.  I'm in retirement just like you.  Once in a while I still help train the Alaskan Scouts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Campbell told me about the situation here.  I thought I might be of some use."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you."},{"character":"Master","line":"Well, I know lots about survival in a harsh environment.

What's your outfit?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm the pawn they sent here to save your worthless butt."},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"Really?  It's true... You don't look like one of them.  In that case, hurry up and get me out of here."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Slow down.  Don't worry.  First I want some information... about the terrorists."},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"The terrorists?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do they really have the ability to launch a nuke?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"What are you talking about?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"The terrorists are threatening the White House.

It's possible.  They... could launch a nuke."},{"character":"action","line":"(The woman in the next cell here this bit of information and stops the sit-ups she was doing.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"How do they plan to launch?  I though this place was just for keeping the dismantled warheads.  THey shouldn't have access to a missile..."},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"What I'm about to tell you is classified information. Okay?  We were conducting excercises of a new type of experimental weapon. A weapon that will change the world."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"A weapon with the ability to launch a nuclear attack from any place on the face of the earth.  A nuclear equipped, walking battle tank."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Metal Gear!?  It can't be!"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"... You knew!?  Metal Gear is one of the most secret black projects!  How did you know that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"We've had a couple of run-ins in the past.

You... you're from the Pentagon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Answer my question!  What about your code!?  There's no time!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I... talked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What!

Oh, don't be a fool."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Anyway, the terrorists have both codes now."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Those boys are totally insane.  They wouldn't hesitate to launch."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I agree.  But what do they really want?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Who knows.  Maybe they're like us in the arms industry... always looking forward to the next good war."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well I'm not going to let these maniacs start a war toady.  Do you still have the card keys."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Card keys?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"To override tge detonation codes!  I heard you had them..."},{"character":"Baker","line":"No, not anymore."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What!?  Who does then!?  Not the terrorists!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"No, that woman."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Woman!?  Who!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"A soldier that was thrown in prison along with me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female soldier?  It must be..."},{"character":"Baker","line":"She said that she had just joined up as a new recruit.  She said they threw her in prison because she refused to take part in the rebellion."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A new recruit?  Could that be the Colonel's niece!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I gave her the key.  Looks like she managed to break out of here though. I hope she's okay."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sure she is.  She's green... but as tough as they come.  But how did you know she escaped?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I was in contact with her by Codec.  Until I was tied up here that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Codec?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  She stole it from the guard.  If she still has it, you should be able to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sure she still has it.  What frequency was she at?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh yeah.  Let me tell you.  It's..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker is struggling to remember.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Huh?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...Oh... sorry... I forgot..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh that's right!  It should be on the back of the CD case.  Try to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll contact her right away.  But tell me... If this doesn't work, is there some other way to prevent the missile launch?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Hmmm.  You need to find Hal Emmerich, one of my employees."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The team leader of the Metal Gear Rex project.  A genius at engineering, but a little bit of an oddball.  If there is anyone who can figure out how to stop Metal Gear from launching, it's him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What if he can't come up with anything?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You'll have to destroy it.  Emmerich knows how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where is this Emmerich?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Well... he's probably being held somewhere in the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building.  It's north from here.  That's where he worked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, but... why Metal Gear?  The Nuclear Age ended with the turn of the millenium."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You're wrong.  The threat of nuclear war isn't gone... in fact it's greater than it's ever been."},{"character":"action","line":"(Scenes of missile launches, storage buildings, and missile silos are shown.)"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The amount of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium is increasing even today.  Listen, have you ever seen a warehouse full of nuclear material?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...No."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Drums and drums of nuclear waste stacked this high.  As far as you can see because there's still no real way to dispose of the stuff."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they just close the lid and pretend like it'll go away?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Essentially, yes.  And they're not even doing a good job of storing it.  Many of the drums are corroded... with nuclear waste seeping out of them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Unbelievable."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Not only that, several pounds of MUF are reported every year."},{"character":"Snake","line":"MUF?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"It stands for \"material unnacounted for\". It proves that there is a large and well organized black market in nuclear materials. Furthermore, since the end of the Cold War, Russian nuclear engineers, in particular, are out of work with nowhere to turn."},{"character":"action","line":"(We go back to the chamber where Snake and Baker are conversing.)"},{"character":"Baker","line":"In other words, there is plenty of nuclear material and scientists for making a bomb.  We live in an age when any small country can have a nuclear weapons program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about the other superpowers?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Russia and China still maintain a signifigant nuclear presence. Complete nuclear disarmament is an impossibility.  To maintain our own policy of deterrance, we need a weapon of overwhelming power."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean Metal Gear."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You know our industry suffered quite a blow as a result of the cut-backs in military budgets, due to this so called \"peace\"."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember hearing a lot about mergers and take-overs among the big weapons makers."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  And after my company lost their bid to produce the Air Force's next fighter jet, the Metal Gear project was out last ace in the hole.  That's why we pushed to have Metal Gear developed as a black project."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Black project?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Secret projects paid for by the Pentagon's black budget.  You can avoid a lot of red tape a get a great lead-time on your weapons production.  And no one can bother you.  Not even those bleeding heart liberals on the military oversight committee."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Bribes."},{"character":"Baker","line":"I prefer to think of it as good buisness.  Anyway, Metal Gear was going to be formally adopted after the results of this exercise were analyzed."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't give a crap about you and your company."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes, that's about what I'd expect from a grunt like you... Here, this is what you came for, right?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker fishes a disc out of his pocket and hands it to Snake.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"An optical disk.  It's all here.  The main hard drive was destroyed by gunfire.  This is the only remaining copy of the data."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What kind of data?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"All the data collected from this exercise.  Don't play dumb.  I know you were sent to get this.  I hid it from that sadistic maniac while he was torturing me.  They don't know that this disk exists. Make sure that you report this to Jim... to your boss.  I'll give you my card too.  It'll open up all level two security doors."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Can you walk?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...No ...You go on without me.  They got my password... they don't want anything else from me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have one more question.  Who or what was that ninja thing?  It looked like you knew something."},{"character":"Baker","line":"That ninja?  That was FOX-HOUND's dark little secret."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Dark little secret?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"An experimantal... genome... soldier..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker coughs once more.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You know him?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You should ask Dr. Naomi Hunter from FOX-HOUND.  She knows better than I."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You've got to stop them.  If it goes public, my company and I are... finished."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?  Doesn't Metal Gear use currently existing technology?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Metal Gear itself does, but..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker bends over in pain.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Huh!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"What... what did you do to me!?  Uh... oooh...no!  ...Ooh.  Oh no, it can't be! ...those Pentagon bastards!  ...So they...they actually went ahead and did it!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"They... they're just... using you for... uuuhhh..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker slumps over and Snake stands in front of him stunned and confused.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What the hell?"},{"character":"action","line":"(After thinking for a moment he calls Campbell on the Codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel!

But... we won't be able to tell without doing an autopsy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I want you and Meryl to work together!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Can I trust her?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"...More than you can trust me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Get in contact with her."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Snake, there is a lot of electrical interferance coming from there.

Okay... you see, this place isn't really for disposing nuclear weapons.  This base is owned and operated by a dummy corporation of ArmsTech."},{"character":"Snake","line":"This is a civilian base?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Right.  For the development of Metal Gear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel!"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"FOX-HOUND and the Next-Generation Special Forces were called here for the test launching of a dummy nuclear warhead."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why FOX-HOUND?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Because they're a Special Ops group used to handling top secret missions.  They figured they could keep it all hush-hush."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But we must have fired nuclear warheads before.  Why just this time?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I heard it was because this was to be a final test before the formal adoption of the Metal Gear program... that's what I heard anyway."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Hmmm... sounds kind of fishy...  So what do you think the terrorists want?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Sorry, I'm not sure.  I was captured with President Baker right after the revolt started."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh yeah, that's when he gave you the detonation override keys, right?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"That's right."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Amazing you were able to keep 'em hidden from the guards."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Well... women have more hiding places than men.  Anyway, you met up with Baker, huh?  How's he holding up?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"He's dead..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"What!?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Heart attack.  Same as the DARPA Chief."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"The Chief died from a heart attck too?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah, was either of them sick or anything?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"No, not that I heard of."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well, I don't believe in coincidences.  Something funny's going on."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Hmmm.  Sounds like it. But I have no idea what."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Me neither... yet.  Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You mean Dr. emmerich?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yes.  Is he still alive?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Probably.  he should be in the second floor basemant of the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building to the north."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Second floor basement?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Yeah, that's where his lab is.  I think they're forcing him to work on the nuclear launching program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Then we'd better do something before he finishes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're right.  In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You plan to take that thing on by yourself, Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It won't be the first time..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"........."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the best way to get to the building where the Doctor is being held?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"There's a cargo door on the first floor of this building that leads to the north."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the security level of the door there?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Five, but it's okay... I've got a level five card."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well, I've got to go save the Doctor.  You should go..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I'm going with you!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No way!  You're still too green.  I want you to hide somewhere."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I'm not green."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh yes you are."},{"character":"Meryl","line":".........."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You pause for just one second in front of your enemy and it's all over!  Good luck doesn't last forever!"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I don't know what happened.  I just couldn't pull the trigger right away.  I never had any problems in training... But when I thought about my bullets tearing through those soldiers' bodies, I hesitated."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Shooting at targets and shooting at living, breathing people are different."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Ever since I was a little girl, I always dreamed of being a soldier.  Every day of my life, I've trained my mind and my body for the one day when I could finally see some real action, and now"},{"character":"Snake","line":"So what now?  You wanna quit?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I can't quit.  I can't alow myself to quit now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Listen, Meryl.  Everybody feels sick the first time they kill someone.  Unfortunately, killing is one of those things that gets easier the more you do it.  In a war, all of mankind's worst emotions, worst traits come out. It's easy to forget what a sin is in the middle of a battlefield."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"But this isn't a war.  It's a terrorist action."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're just a little jumpy from the combat high.  The adrenaline in your blood is starting to whin out.  Just take it easy."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"But I learned all about combat high at the academy..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We'll talk about it later.  For now, just think about keeping yourself alive."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"If I get out of here alive, I'll think about that other stuff."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, let me try to say this another way... Stay the hell out of my way."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You're a real bastard, just like my uncle said."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Ha ha, I told you.  The real me is no match for the legend."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"It looks like you were right.  Okay Snake, I'll be a good girl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We'll link up after I grab the Doctor.  Then we'll take care of the detonation code override."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Got ya.  But listen, I know this area better than you.  Call me if you have any questions."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Be careful, okay?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"After I open up the cargo door, I'll contact you."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake signs off and waits for Meryl to open the door.

Where are you?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Where I can see ya."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't move around too much."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Don't worry, I'm disguised in this enemy uniform."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You won't be for long with the way you walk."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"What does that mean?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh... nothing."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Listen Snake, the cargo door is like an airlock.  It's equipped with infrared sensors.  Be careful.  If an intruder is sensed, gas is released."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Gas..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Okay, so we'll meet at the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Wait!  You said you'd stay put and be a good girl!"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I changed my mind."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't get careless.  That is when things always turn sour."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Sorry, but this is the only way I can figure out whether or not I'm cut out to be a soldier... I gotta get my hands dirty."},{"character":"Snake","line":"These guys are proffesionals.  You're gonna get yourself killed."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"See ya there!"},{"character":"action","line":"(The cargo door opens and Snake passes the infrared sensors easily by using his cigarettes to see the beams.

The informant from the Watergate scandal?"},{"character":"Deepthroat","line":"Never mind about that."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're not using burst transmission.

You should crawl on the ground like the Snake you are."},{"character":"action","line":"(Raven jumps back into the tank.)"},{"character":"Raven","line":"Come.  Let's fight!"},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake battles the tank and defeats it.  The tank blows up and a Genome Soldier is thrown violently out of the tank, he lands on the ground dead.

I told you so.

There's lots of boxes piled up here, but... are they all warheads?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes.  They're all dismantled warheads."},{"character":"Snake","line":"They just leave them here?  It's like President Baker said... totally careless."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They're working on a limited budget.

Emmerich shows Snake some of the supercomputers used to do the testing)"},{"character":"Emmerich","line":"These are some of the supercomputers.

And that's why we can't let the terrorist attack go public."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We still haven't even ratified Start 2 or dealt with the issue of TMDs.

But he's already started to decompose."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"What could it all be about?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"SOmething in his blood that they wanted?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I doubt it.  Just the nanomachines and the transmitter."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Did the Chief tell them his detonation code?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm afraid so.  It looks like they've got both codes and are nearly ready to launch."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Damn.  Is there any way to prevent it?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It seems there's some type of emergency override device that can cancel out the detonation code.  It's a countermeasure that ArmsTech installed secretly.  You have to unlock it with three special card keys."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"And where are those keys?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I've got one of them.  I don't know where the other two are. Besides, I'm locked up here."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We've got no choice.  Forget about the keys.  Your top priority now is to destroy Metal Gear itself.  Sorry to lay it all in your lap, but you're all I've got.

That's all I know."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And you were able to kill him, knowing that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yup."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"He wanted it.  Besides, some people just need killing..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's patricide."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yup.  That's the trauma that Mantis was talking about.  The one we share in common."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Is that why you left FOX-HOUND?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Let's just say that I needed to be alone for a while and Alaska was the perfect place..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...Snake... I didn't have a real family either.  Just a big brother who put me through school.

We did.  In Zanzibar.  But it was nothing personal. We were just proffesionals on opposite sides, that's all."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And you still call yourselves friends?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Hard to believe?  War is no reason to end a friendship."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's insane."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I first met him on the battlefield.  He was being held a prisoner of Outer Heaven.  But he didn't look like a prisoner to me.  He was always so cool and precise.  I was still green and he showed me the ropes."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You knew him well?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No.  We never talked about our personal lives.  Sort of an unwritten rule.  The nest time I saw him on the battlefield, we were enemies.  We were fighting barehanded in a minefield.  I know it sounds strange to most people.

We are animals."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"So if you were friends, then how do you explain the Ninja's behavior?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't know."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It's your genes... they make you predisposed towards violence!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You really like talking about genes, Naomi.  Why did you get into genetic research anyway?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I never knew who my parents were or even what they looked like. I guess I got into genetics because I wanted to figure out why I'm the way I am."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So you studied about DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yeah.  I thought if I studied my genetic structure, I'd find out who I really was.  I thought that by analyzing a person's genetic information, I could retrieve the blank spots in that person's memory."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Memory is stored in DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"We're not sure.  But we know that a person's genetic fate is determined just by the sequence of the four bases in their DNA."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So what about my fate? You know my DNA sequence, don't you?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Your fate?  I...I'm sorry.  I have no idea."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Of course not.

That way it can get around all sorts of international treaties."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Pretty sneaky."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yes, but effective.  And that's not even the scariest thing about this weapon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't wait to hear this."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"It's a stealth weapon!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean it won't show up on radar?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah.  The truth is... they've been working on a stealth missile since the late 70's."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why weren't they able to develope one until now?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Because of the missile's rocket propulsion system... it will be picked up by enemy satellites."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh yeah, that makes sense."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"But unlike a missile, the rail gun doesn't burn any propellant.  So it can't be detected by any current ballistic missile detection systems."},{"character":"Snake","line":"An invisible nuclear warhead..."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Totally impossible to intercept.  And on top of that, it's got a surface piercing warhead designed to penetrate hardened underground bases."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We learned that lesson in the Gulf War."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"This thing could mean the end of the world!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It's the ultimate weapon.  And from a political point of view, it avoids the problem of nuclear reduction and nuclear inspections. Colonel, is this true?  Are you listening?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm listening..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If word of this got out, it could delay the signing of the Start 3 Treaty and cause a huge international incident."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah, it would be nasty.  The United States would be denounced by the UN... it could even bring the President down..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did you know this, Colonel?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You've changed, Colonel."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I won't make any excuses..."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Snake, listen to me.  This new nuclear weapon... it's never actually been tested, only simulated."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean they ran a computer model?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah, that's why they were conducting this excercise.  They needed to get actual data to back up the simulation."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What were the results of the excercise?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"It looks like it went better than they hoped for.  But...I can't find the data anywhere on this network.  You'd think that data as important as that would be carefully recorded..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"It was.  President Baker gave me an optical disc with all of the test data."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"What!? Do you still have it?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, Ocelot took it from me."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Damn..."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"The terrorists have replaced the dummy warhead with a real warhead. Once they input the detonation codes, they should be ready to launch."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So you think they can do it?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Well the dummy warhead was designed to be identical to the real thing, so I think so."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did you find out how to override it yet?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Not yet.  It must be in a separate file.  Right now, I'm looking through all of Baker's personal files."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We're counting on you..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake enters the control center of the Rex hangar.  He sees Liquid and Ocelot talking.)"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Okay. I've entered the PAL codes and disengaged the safety device. We can launch anytime."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"There's still no response from Washington. It looks like we'll have to show them that we mean business."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Should I set it for Chernoton, Russia?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"No, there's been a change. The new target is...Lopnor, China."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Why Boss?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"I'm sure neither you nor Mr. Gurlukovich would really like to see a nuclear bomb dropped on your Motherland, right?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid!"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"But why? There's nothing there."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Wrong. It's a nuclear test site."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"A nuclear test site?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"If we nuke a major population center, the game's over... But a nuclear explosion at a test site can still be concealed from the public. Meanwhile Washington will be worried about the retaliatory strike from China."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"That'll probably mean top secret talks between both countries' leaders..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Of course. And in the process, the President will be forced to divulge the existence of a new and highly destabilizing nuclear weapon to the Chinese. What do you think that will do to the U.S.'s reputation? Or the President's?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"And with the CTBT, that means that China and India... I see..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Yes. When the other countries hear about this new weapon, they'll all want to contact us. Washington won't be very happy when we start selling their own system to the highest bidders. Yes. The President will break. He will give in to our demands."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Big Boss's DNA and one billion dollars..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One billion dollars!"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"That money will be used to cure our genome soldiers as well. I'm also including the FoxDie vaccine in our demands."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"FoxDie... It killed Octopus and the ArmsTech president... So it's true that it affects older people first. Mantis might not have been affected because he wore a mask."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Wolf wasn't infected either. Perhaps due to those tranquilizers she always took."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Something to do with the adrenaline level in the blood? Or maybe it's just because this FoxDie was still experimental and they haven't worked out all the bugs yet..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"In any case, have you heard from your friend, Colonel Sergei Gurlukovich at the Spetznaz?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"He still has doubts about the ability of Metal Gear. He said we can talk after Metal Gear's test launch is successful."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"He is a very prudent man."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"There's nothing to worry about. The Colonel wants Metal Gear and the new nuclear weapon so bad he can taste it. If Russia wants to regain its position as a military superpower, they need to reinforce their nuclear arsenal. They need a nuclear weapon that can't be intercepted. Metal Gear will allow them to gain first strike capability over the rest of the world."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Their regular army is in shambles and they think they can restore their country's military power with nuclear weapons? Gurlukovich... he's no warrior... he is a politician."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"But he's the one who gave us the Hind and most of our other heavy firepower."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"He's got over a thousand soldiers under his command. If we joined forces we could put up quite a resistance here. Since Mantis died, the genome soldiers' brainwashing has started to wear off. I'm worried about the men's morale. An alliance with the Russians would boost that as well..."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"What are you saying?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"We're not going anywhere. We're going to dig in here."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"We could still escape..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"We've got the most powerful weapon ever made and we're about to ally with Gurlukovich's forces."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Are you going to fight the whole world?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"And what's wrong with that? We can launch a nuclear warhead at any target on this planet... A nuclear warhead invisible to radar. And on top of that, this base is full of spare nuclear warheads. Once we get the DNA and the money, the world will be ours!"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"What about your promise to Colonel Gurlukovich?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"I have no interest in the revival of Mother Russia."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"...You're not thinking of reviving Big Boss's dream?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"From today, ...call this place \"Outer Heaven\"."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Big Boss's dream..."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"But Boss,... you're not worried about the PAL being overridden? If the code is entered again, it'll be deactivated."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"No need to worry. The DARPA Chief and the ArmsTech president are both dead."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Does Snake know how the override system works?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"You interrogated him. Don't you know?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"He didn't have any keys on him."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Good. Then no one can stop Metal Gear now."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"By the way, what should we do with that woman? Want me to kill her?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Let her live. She's Campbell's niece and Snake cares for her... We'll keep her as our ace in-the-hole."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Meryl... she's alive."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Snake, I found Baker's top-secret files!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Great job."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"How's it going there?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"They've finished inputting the PAL codes. So how do we deactivate them?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Okay...y'see the override system that the president was talking about... It can also be used to input the detonation codes. Y'see if you insert the keys when the warhead is active, you deactivate it. And if you insert them when it's inactive, it becomes activated. And you can only use the keys once."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Only once, huh."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah...you'd better get started. We don't have much time."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But it takes three keys, right!? I've only got one of them!"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Hold on a minute. Y'see that's the trick. You already have all three keys!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"The card key is made of a shape memory alloy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Shape memory alloy?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yes. It's a material that changes shape at different temperatures. The key is made out of it!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"This card key?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah. The card key changes shape at different temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So this key is actually three keys in one...clever."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Can you see the input terminals in the center of the Control Room..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I see them."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Those three laptop terminals are for the emergency input. There should be a symbol on each screen... Each symbol corresponds to a different key. Input the keys in order from left to right. The left one's for the room temperature key. See the symbol? Next to that goes the low temperature key. The one on the right is the high temperature key."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, I got it. First I change the shape of the card and then I input them in order, right?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"That's right. All you do is insert the card keys. After you insert the key into the module, a hard disk reads the information contained on it. Once you've finished with all three terminals, the code input process is complete. But here's the thing. You can only use the key three times. It's an emergency system and it's only meant to be used once."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The world is riding on that key, Snake."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Who's that!!"},{"character":"action","line":"(Ocelot fires a bullet at Snake.  Snake is startled and loses his grip on the key.  It tumbles over the railing and falls into the drainage ditch.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!! The key fell in the drainage ditch!"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Snake!! This is bullet-proof glass! There's no way in! I'll enjoy watching you die!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, you've got to get that key!"},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake finds the key and heads back up to the control room to input the code.)"},{"character":"Computer","line":"PAL code number one confirmed. Awaiting PAL code number two..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, that takes care of PAL code number one... Now PAL number two... freeze the key."},{"character":"Computer","line":"PAL code number two confirmed. Awaiting PAL code number three..."},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake. It's about Naomi Hunter..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Then you should talk to the Colonel. He's looking into it."},{"character":"Master","line":"Turn your monitor off."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay it's off. No one else can hear us. Go ahead."},{"character":"Master","line":"Sorry, but I didn't want the Colonel to hear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, so what's up?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I've got a good friend in the Pentagon..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah..."},{"character":"Master","line":"He's the one who told me about it... It looks like the DIA recently developed a new type of assassination weapon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"An assassination weapon?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake, have you ever heard of something called \"Fox Die\"?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No..."},{"character":"Master","line":"Fox Die?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...Liquid and others were talking about it..."},{"character":"Master","line":"Yeah. It's some kind of virus that targets specific people. I don't know all the details, but..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you trying to say?"},{"character":"Master","line":"It's too similar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What is!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"The cause of death. Didn't the ArmsTech president and the DARPA Chief, I mean Decoy Octopus,... die of something that looked like a heart attack?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah...?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Well, apparently Fox Die kills its victims by simulating a heart attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No... You're telling me that Naomi was behind it?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake, try to remember. Did Naomi give you some kind of injection?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...The nanomachines."},{"character":"Master","line":"She was in the best position to have done it, but I don't know what her motive was."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...Does the Colonel know?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I'm not sure. But he still hasn't questioned her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay. I'll ask him myself. Colonel, what's new with the Naomi situation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I just placed Naomi under arrest."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Arrest?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She was sending coded messages towards the Alaskan base. I didn't want to believe it, but she must be working with the terrorists."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Are you sure?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. She's being interrogated now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What kind of interrogation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well...I'd like to avoid the rough stuff, but we don't even have any sodium pentathol here."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Call me if you find out anything."},{"character":"Master","line":"So it's true, isn't it?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi...I can't believe it."},{"character":"Master","line":"That means the Fox Die vaccine must be around somewhere."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Listen. I've got bigger things to worry about."},{"character":"Master","line":"But Snake...you might be infected too, you know."},{"character":"Snake","line":"All I can do is leave it up to the Colonel."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake goes to input the rest of the PAL Codes and during the process he gets a Codec call.)"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Snake, can you hear me?  It's Naomi..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi!? ...what the hell!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Campbell and the others are busy right now...I'm on a different Codec."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi, is what the Colonel says true?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...Yes.  But not everything I said was a lie. I don't know myself. I don't know my real name or even what my parents looked like.  I bought all my identification. But my reason for getting into genetics was true."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Cause you want to know yourself, right?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right. I want to know where I came from...m...my age, my race... anything."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I was found in Rhodesia sometime in the 80's... a dirty little orphan..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Rhodesia? What's now known as Zimbabwe?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. Rhodesia was owned by England until 1965 and there were lots of Indian laborers around.  That's probably where I got my skin color from, but I'm not even sure about that..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi, you're too worried about the past. Isn't it enough to understand who you are now?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Understand who I am now!?  Why should I? No one else tries to understand me.  I was alone for so long... until I met my big brother and him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Your big brother?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes.... Frank Jaeger."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"He was a young soldier, when he picked me up near the Zambezi River.  I was half-dead from starvation and he shared his rations with me."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. Frank Jaeger, the man who you destroyed, was my brother and my only family."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Gray Fox?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"We survived that hell together, Frank and I.  He protected me. He's my one connection... the only connection that I have to my past."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And he brought you back to America?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"No.  I was in Mozambique when \"he\" came."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who is \"he\" ? ...You mean Big Boss?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"He brought us to this land of freedom , this America. But then he and my brother went back to Africa to continue the war.  And that's when it happened... You killed my benefactor and sent my brother home a cripple.  I vowed revenge and joined FOX-HOUND.  I knew it was my best chance to meet you and I prayed for the day that I ould..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So were your prayers answered?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. I waited two long years..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"To kill me?  Is that all you cared about?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. That's right.  Two years.  You were all I thought about for two long years...like some kind of twisted obsession..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do you still hate me?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...Not exactly.  I was partly wrong about you..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about Liquid and the others?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"No. I'll have my revenge on them too."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi...you didn't kill that doctor too, did you?  The one that used Gray Fox for his genome experiments..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...No...that was my brother.  Afterwards I covered it up and helped him hide out..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So that Ninja...I mean Gray Fox... he's come here to kill me?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...I don't think so.  I think he just came here to fight you... I wasn't sure before, but now I think I understand.  A final battle with you... that's all he lives for. I'm sure of it..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...Fox...no... Naomi, tell me something..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...about FoxDie?  FoxDie is a type of retrovirus that targets and kills only specific people.  First, it infects the macrophages in the victim's body.  FoxDie contains smart enzymes, created through protein engineering.  They're programmed to respond to specific genetic patterns in the cells."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Those enzymes recognize the target's DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Right. They respond by becoming active, and using the macrophages, they begin creating TNF epsilon.  It's a type of cytokine, a peptide which causes cells to die.  The TNF epsilon is carried along the bloodstream to the heart, where they attach to the TNF receptors in the heart cells."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And then...they cause a heart attack?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The heart cells suffer a shock and undergo an extreme apoptosis. Then... the victim dies."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Apoptosis...you mean the heart cells commit suicide... Naomi..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...What?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...You must have programmed that thing to kill me too, right? Do I still have time? Naomi, I don't blame you for wanting me dead.  But I can't go yet. I still have a job to do."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Listen, Snake.  I'm not the one who made the decision to use FoxDie."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You weren't?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You were injected with FoxDie as a part of this operation. I just wanted to let you know that... No, that's not the whole truth... the real thing that I wanted to tell you was... Snake, I... I..."},{"character":"Voice","line":"Hey! What are you doing!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Eeeek!!  Ooooh.... Snake....."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"...Snake, I can't allow Naomi to make any more unauthorized transmissions.  Naomi's been removed from this operation."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What happened to Naomi!? What did she mean when she said that FoxDie was a part of this operation!?  Colonel, let me talk to her!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I won't. She's under arrest."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...you double crossed me!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, there's no time for that!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Right now your job is to stop Metal Gear! ...Okay, Snake!?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake inputs the second PAL code.)"},{"character":"Computer","line":"PAL code number two conirmed.  Awaiting PAL code number three."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, there goes PAL code number two. Next comes PAL number three... warm the key."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake Inputs the third PAL code.)"},{"character":"Computer","line":"PAL code number three confirmed. PAL code entry complete... Detonation code activated."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No! Why!"},{"character":"Computer","line":"Ready for launch..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake recieves a Codec call from Master Miller.)"},{"character":"Master","line":"Thank you Snake.  Now the detonation code is completed. Nothing can stop Metal Gear now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Master, what's going on?"},{"character":"Master","line":"You found the key and even activated the warhead for us too. I really must express my gratitude.  Sorry to have involved you in that silly shape memory alloy business.  We weren't able to learn the DARPA Chief's code.  Even with Mantis' psychic powers, he couldn't read his mind.  Then Ocelot accidentally killed him during the interrogation.  In other words, we weren't able to launch the nuclear device and we were all getting a little worried.  Without the threat of a nuclear strike, our demands would never be met."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you mean?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Without the detonation codes, we had to find some other way. That's when we decided...you might prove useful, Snake.  First I thought we might get the information from you, Snake.  So I had Decoy Octopus disguise himself as the DARPA Chief.  Unfortunately Octopus didn't survive the encounter. ...thanks to FoxDie."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean you had this planned from the beginning? Just to get me to input the detonation code!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Huh? You didn't think you made it this far by yourself, did you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who the hell are you!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"In any case, the launch preparations are complete.  Once the world glimpses the power of this weapon, the White House will have no choice but to surrender the FoxDie vaccine to me. Their ace-in-the- hole is useless now..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Ace-in-the-hole?"},{"character":"Master","line":"The Pentagon's plan to use you was already successful... in the torture room."},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake, you're the only one who doesn't know.  Poor fool."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who are you anyway!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I'll tell you everything you want to know.  If you come to where I am, that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where are you?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Very close by."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, that's not Master Miller!"},{"character":"Master","line":"Campbell, you're too late."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Master Miller's body was just discovered at his home.  He's been dead for at least three days.  I didn't know because my Codec link with Master was cut off.  But Mei Ling said his transmission signal was coming from inside the base!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"So who is it?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, you've been talking to..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"...Me... dear brother."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid!? How the...!?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"You've served your purpose.  You may die now!"},{"character":"action","line":""},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake dashes outside and sees Liquid about to clmib intot he cockpit of Rex. He levels his SOCOM at him.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid!!"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Snake, did you like my sunglasses? You'd point a weapon at your own brother?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why did you disguise yourself as Master?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"So I could manipulate you more easily. And you performed quite well I must say. Although the boys at the Pentagon are probably saying the same thing..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What the hell are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Following orders blindly with no questions asked. You've lost your warrior's pride and become nothing more than a pawn, Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Stopping the nuclear launch, rescuing the hostages... It was all just a diversion."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A diversion?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"The Pentagon only needed for you to come into contact with us. That's what killed the ArmsTech president and Decoy Octopus."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You don't mean..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"That's right. You were sent in here to kill us so they could retrieve Metal Gear undamaged along with the bodies of the genome soldiers. From the beginning, the Pentagon was just using you as a vector to spread FoxDie!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Fox Die! ...It can't be! Are you telling me Naomi was working with the Pentagon?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"They thought she was. But it seems that Dr. Naomi Hunter couldn't be controlled so easily."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"We've got a spy working in the Pentagon. He reported that Dr. Hunter altered FoxDie's program just before the operation. But...no one knows how or why."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I wonder... maybe they arrested her so they could find out the answer to that."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"No doubt. But I had no idea she was motivated by such petty revenge... we still don't know what changes she made to FoxDie's program. Oh well. It doesn't matter. I've already added the FoxDie vaccine to my list of White House demands."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's a vaccine?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"There must be. But that woman is the only one who really knows. Anyway, it might prove to be unnecessary."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why is that?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"You were successful in coming into contact with all of us, so we must have all been exposed to the virus. It's true that the ArmsTech president and Decoy Octopus were killed by FoxDie... But Ocelot, myself, and you, the carrier, were apparently unaffected."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A bug in the virus' programming?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Hmm, could be. In any case, if it doesn't kill you then I'm not worried either. After all, our genetic code is identical."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So it's true...you and I are..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Yes, twins, but we're not ordinary twins... we're twins linked by cursed genes. Les enfants terribles. You're fine. You got all the old man's dominant genes. I got all the flawed, recessive genes. Everything was done so that you would be the greatest of his children. The only reason I exist is so they could create you."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was the favorite, huh."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"That's right! I'm just the leftovers of what they used to make you. Can you understand what it's like to know that you're garbage since the day you were born!? But...I'm the one father chose."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...So that's why you're so obsessed with Big Boss. Some warped kind of love."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Love!? It's hate!! He always told me I was inferior and now I'll have my revenge!! You should understand me, brother. You killed our father with your own hands! You stole my chance for revenge! Now I'll finish the work that father began. I will surpass him... I will destroy him!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're just like Naomi."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Well I'm not like you. Unlike you, I'm proud of the destiny that is encoded into my very genes. Yeah!"},{"character":"action","line":"(Liqud hops into Rex's ockpit.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!!"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Snake! Your blood will be the first to be spilt by this glorious new weapon. Consider it an honor... a gift from your brother. Now, I'll show you!

I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They're heavily armed I'm afraid."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about they're battle experience."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The six members of FOX-HOUND in charge are all hardened veterans. They're tough enough to eat nails and ask for seconds."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The others are Next-Generation Special Forces. They're not your average grunts either."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They started out as an anti-terrorist special-ops unit made up of members from former biochem units, technical escort units, and the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Their purpose was to respond to threats involving next-generation weapons of mass destruction, including NBC (nuclear/biological/chemica) weapons."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Until \"they\" were added that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's \"they\"?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"These guys didn't start out as regular army."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a pretty international group. Mercenaries?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yeah. And it gets worse. Most of them were from a merc agency that I think you're familiar with. They were part of Big Boss' private guard. And after Big Boss went down, the military just bought out all their contracts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Outer Heaven."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"After that they were merged with our own VR unit, Force 21, and re-trained. If you ask me, these so-called \"Next-Generation Special Forces\" should to be called \"simulated soldiers.\" They have no real battle experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Video game players, huh?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy. They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers. Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by international law."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes, but those are just declarations not actual treaties."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit conspired in this attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"They're calling it a revolution."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Since they all went through the same gene therapy, they probably felt closer than brothers. They see the unit as their only family."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss. But if they were regular army, they must've been interviewed periodically by army counsellers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"According to their files, they all got straight A's on their psychological tests. They all seemed like fine, upstanding patriotic soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But they all took part in the uprising?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No. Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise. That's why there was a resupply of troops."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Apparently they consulted classified information about the soldier genes and performed their own gene therapy experiments."},{"character":"Snake","line":"They can do that even without you?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well our gene therapy process is almost completely automated. And besides that they're all geniuses with IQs over 180."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Even the existence of this genome army is a national secret of the highest order. We'd been hoping to investigate this quietly and deal with it behind closed doors."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Hi-Tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND. Your former unit, and one that I was a commander of. An elite group combining firepower and expertise. They're every bit as good as when I was commanding them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they're still around."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are six members of FOX-HOUND involved in this terrorist activity. Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities. Sniper Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter. Decoy Octopus, master of disguise. Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman. And Revolver Ocelot, specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a lovely bunch of folks. Too bad we'll be meeting under these circumstances."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"And finally, in charge of them, FOX-HOUND's squad leader Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake?!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes and you're the only person who can stand against him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Liquid Snake. The man with the same codename as you."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me what you know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager, the youngest person in the SAS (British Special Air Service).  His job was to track down and destroy mobile SCUD missile launching platforms. You were there too I believe. Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was just a kid myself back then."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The details are classified, but it seems that originally he penetrated the the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS."},{"character":"Snake","line":"He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But he never once showed his face in Century House. He was taken prisoner in Iraq, and after that there was no trace of him for several years. After you retired, he was rescued and became a member of FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using codenames."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know his real name. That information is so highly classified that even I can't look at it. Here's a photo of him.  Pretty shocking, huh?  His skin tone is a little different but otherwise you two are exact duplicates."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have a twin?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know the details, but it seems so. That's why we really need you for this mission."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're the only one who can beat him. Now that I've met you, I know. You've got something he doesn't. I can see it in your eyes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why don't I find that thought more comforting?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore. Let me go back to Twin Lakes."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Why Snake? Is your life in Alaska all that great?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's a dogsled race this week. Next Saturday I have to be in Anchorage."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The Iditarod? The longest sled race in the world? When did you become a dog musher?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Right now my fifty huskies are my only family. I've got to take care of them."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry about your dogs."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you mean?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry Snake but this vessel is headed for the Bering Sea. There's no room for debate."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I told you, even if I do owe you I don't anything to this army or this country!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You will accept this assignment!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why should I be stupid enough to do that? I'm no patriot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, there's enough dirt in your file from your days as an agent to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh I see. Blackmail."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No Snake. I prefer to look at it as helping you to come to a decision more easily. But anyway, I know you better than that. You'd take this assignment even without the threat."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why do you say that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You're a natural born soldier. You're not the grow old gracefully type. Same for all of us who've seen real action. The only place we can feel truly alive is on the battlefield. I'm a solider too. I know those feelings of powerlessness, frustration that you feel everyday. You've tried to play the boy scout out there in Alaska, but you can't race dogs in the snow forever.  Why don't you come back to us and be a soldier again."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You think my life is some kind of joke?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I just want to give you back your purpose in life."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're retired. Why are you involved in this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because there aren't many people who know FOX-HOUND as well as I do."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Is that really the only reason?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've been soldiering for a long time, I don't know anything else. I guess even though I'm getting a little old, I still love to be in the field."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're a lousy liar. Tell me the real reason."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Okay Snake. Sorry. I'll be frank. A person very dear to me is being held hostage."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who is it?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"My niece. Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What was your niece doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt. And my niece was one of those called in as an emergency replacement."},{"character":"Snake","line":"She looks like you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's my little brother's girl. He died in the Gulf War. Since then I've been watching after her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A personal motive, Colonel. That's not very soldierly."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm retired. I'm just an old man now. And I'm your friend."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Since when are we friends?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've thought of us as friends since the fall of Zanzibar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"With my personality I don't have too many friends."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's what I trust about you. It's what makes you human. Please Snake. Save my niece Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"All right, but I have two conditions."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Name them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One, no more secrets between us. I want complete disclosure at all times and two, I'll only accept orders from you, Colonel. No cutoffs involved okay?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Agreed. That's why I was called. But one thing."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not a colonel anymore. Just a retired old warhorse."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, Colonel."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That doctor. Is she part of this operation too?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She was in charge of FOX-HOUND's gene therapy. She knows more about those men than anyone else."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean you've seen them naked?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Make no mistake. I'm not a nurse. I'm a scientist."},{"character":"Snake","line":"By the way, what was that injection for?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It's a combination of and nanomachines and an anti-freezing peptide so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze, even at sub-arctic temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nanomachines?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Not just one kind either. There are different types which will replenish the supply of adrenaline, nutrition and sugar in your bloodstream."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Now I don't have to worry about food."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I also put some nootropics in there."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Say what?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Nootropics. It's a class of drugs which will help improve your mental functioning."},{"character":"Snake","line":"It'll make smarter huh? Anything else?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Benzedrine. It's a type of stimulant. It'll keep you alert and responsive for twelve straight hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That was quite a cocktail. Anything else in there?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Those nanomachines will also keep your Codec's batteries charged up."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're welcome."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I need to borrow your scissors."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"What are you going to do?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't worry. Just going to clean myself up a little."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Huh?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't want to be mistaken for the leader of the terrorists."},{"character":"action","line":""},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake swims through the lower dock of the disposal facility.  We see a man riding up the cargo elevator.)"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Stay alert!  He'll be through here, I know it.  I'm going to go swat down a couple of bothersome flies."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake removes his flippers and calls Campbell on the codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"This is Snake.  Colonel, can you hear me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Loud and clear Snake.  What's the situation?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Just as I expected.  You'll have to take the elevator to the surface.  But make sure that nobody sees you.  If you need to contact me by codec, the frequency is 140.85.  When you want to use the codec push the Select button. When we need to contact you the codec will beep.  When you hear that noise push the Select button. The codec directly stimulates the small bones of your ear, no one but you will be able to hear it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Got it, okay, I'm ready to go."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake takes off his scuba gear and watches the landscape slide by as the elevator ascends.  The title appears on the screen \"Metal Gear Solid\".  The elevator stops and Snake quickly runs out and looks for cover behind a storage crate.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It's Snake.  I'm in front of the disposal facility."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Excellent, Snake.  Age hasn't slowed you down one bit."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How's that Sneaking Suit working out?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm nice and dry, but it is a little hard to move."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Bear with it.  It's designed to prevent hypothermia.  This is Alaska you know."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Take it easy, I'm grateful.  If it wasn't for your suit and your shot I would have turned into a popsicle out there."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"An anti-freezing peptide Snake.  All of the Genome soldiers in this exercise are using it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm relieved to hear that.  Already tested, huh?  By the way, how's the diversionary operation going?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.  The terrorist's radar should have picked them up by now."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake peers out from behind the crate and sees a group of terrorists by a helicopter.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"A Hind D?  Colonel, what's a Russian gunship doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I have no idea...but it looks like our little diversion got their attention.  Now's your best chance to slip in unnoticed."},{"character":"action","line":"(The helicopter takes off, throwing snow in all directions, the guards on the ground shield their eyes as they follow it up into the sky.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are only 18 hours left until their deadline.  You've got to hurry."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Wow...you must be crazy to fly a Hind in this kind of weather."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Oh sorry, I haven't introduced you two yet.  This is Mei Ling.  She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist. She designed your codec, as well as your Soliton radar system. Contact her if you have any questions about either of them."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Nice to meet you Snake.  It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"What's wrong?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nothing...I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so...cute."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"You're just flattering me..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, I'm serious.  Now I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"C'mon, I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake... But I'm surprised, you're very frank for a trained killer."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting the man behind the legend...but first, let me explain about your Soliton radar system."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"The bright dot in the middle is you Snake.  The red dots are your enemies and the blue cone shape represents their field of vision."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Be careful Snake. The Genome soldiers have highly developed senses of hearing and vision due to their gene therapy.  Make sure you don't let them see you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"First I want you to infiltrate the disposal site and look for the DARPA Chief."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The DARPA Chief was injected with the same GPS transmitting nanomachines as you."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"He should appear on your radar as a green dot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Get whatever information you can from him about the terrorists.  If he's alive that is..."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Snake, your radar isn't affected by the weather, but if you're discovered by an enemy you won't be able to use it."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, it gets jammed easily I'm afraid."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Yes, it's all made from currently existing technology.  You won't be able to use it in an area with strong harmonic resonance.  So be careful."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll be monitoring your movements by radar... so contact us by Codec anytime  you want."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Got it.  I'll call if I'm feeling lonely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Seriously Snake.  We're here to back you up, so call if you need some information or advice."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"I'm also in charge of your mission data.  Contact me if you want me to record your current status.  My frequency is 140.96.  It's a dedicated frequency for saving data.  Don't forget it."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Remember, except for your binoculars you're naked.  You need to arm yourself with whatever weapons you can find."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember.  First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here, and then all my weapons are taken away.  Imagine yourself put in that position."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well, if yck in one you make it back in one piece, maybe I'll let you do a strip search on me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll hold you to that doctor.  By the way, sorry to dissapoint you but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How did you do that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"In my stomach.  Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach acids."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Cigarettes?  How are those going to help you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You never know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"If you want to get in, there's the front door."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake pulls out his binoculars and takes a look.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"It's the fastest way, but there's too much risk of being spotted by the enemy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't just knock on the door and ask them to let me in.  One sentry on the left and one on the right.  They're armed with \"five five sixers\" and pineapples..."},{"character":"action","line":"(As the guard on the right approaches Snake puts back his binoculars and hides behind the crate again.  Then he goes over to the left and pulls out his binoculars again.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"What about the air duct near the door?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake locates the duct but it is guarded, he pans up to the upper level of the facility.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There should also be a duct on the second floor."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake looks across to the walkway on the second floor to find the vent but his view is blocked by the railing.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't see it from here."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake lowers his binoculars and once again hides behind the crate.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'll let you decide the best COA.  I'm counting on you Snake."},{"character":"action","line":"(The game resumes and the player takes control.  Eventually, Snake enters the vent on the second floor of the facility, he gets a codec call from Master Miller, his old instructor.)"},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake, it's been a long time."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Master?  What are you doing here?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some peace and quiet.  I'm in retirement just like you.  Once in a while I still help train the Alaskan Scouts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Campbell told me about the situation here.  I thought I might be of some use."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you."},{"character":"Master","line":"Well, I know lots about survival in a harsh environment.  I've lived in Alaska longer than you, so call me if you have any questions about the flora or fauna out here.

Don't get careless now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Woman in the cell?"},{"character":"Genome 2","line":"Did something happen?"},{"character":"Genome 1","line":"There's an intruder."},{"character":"Genome 2","line":"Really?"},{"character":"Genome 1","line":"He's already done three people."},{"character":"Genome 2","line":"He's killed three people?"},{"character":"Genome 1","line":"Yeah.  They say he's using stealth too."},{"character":"Genome 2","line":"Stealth?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's an intruder besides me?"},{"character":"Genome 1","line":"Anyway, I want you to increase the security detail on the chief."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake finds the DARPA chief in his cell and drops down through a vent opening.)"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"Who... who, who's that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm here to save you.

What's your outfit?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm the pawn they sent here to save your worthless butt."},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"Really?  It's true... You don't look like one of them.  In that case, hurry up and get me out of here."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Slow down.  Don't worry.  First I want some information... about the terrorists."},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"The terrorists?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do they really have the ability to launch a nuke?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"What are you talking about?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"The terrorists are threatening the White House.  They say if they don't accede to their demands they'll launch a nuclear weapon."},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"Sweet Jesus..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Is it possible?!"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"... It's possible.  They... could launch a nuke."},{"character":"action","line":"(The woman in the next cell here this bit of information and stops the sit-ups she was doing.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"How do they plan to launch?  I though this place was just for keeping the dismantled warheads.  THey shouldn't have access to a missile..."},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"What I'm about to tell you is classified information. Okay?  We were conducting excercises of a new type of experimental weapon. A weapon that will change the world."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"A weapon with the ability to launch a nuclear attack from any place on the face of the earth.  A nuclear equipped, walking battle tank."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Metal Gear!?  It can't be!"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"... You knew!?  Metal Gear is one of the most secret black projects!  How did you know that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"We've had a couple of run-ins in the past.

It's set up so that you need to input two different passwords in order to launch the device."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There are two passwords?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"Yes.  Baker knows one and I know one."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Baker?  The president of ArmsTech?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"That's right.

You can stop the launch."},{"character":"action","line":"(The woman in the next cell hears this.)"},{"character":"Woman","line":"That card key... ?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"So where are the keys?"},{"character":"DARPA chief","line":"Baker should have them.

You... you're from the Pentagon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Answer my question!  What about your code!?  There's no time!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I... talked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What! Now the terrorists have both codes and can launch anytime!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"It's not like I didn't fight.

How'd you do it?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Surgical implants in my brain."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Surgical implants?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Kind of like a psychic insulation.

In that case, how did they get your code?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I never had any training on how to resist torture..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker coughs violently, he is obviously in very bad shape.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It looks like he had some fun with you all right."},{"character":"Baker","line":"He's not human.

His was sliced off."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Ha. You're a funny man.  ...So... the DARPA Chief... is he okay?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Dead."},{"character":"Baker","line":"What!?  It can't be!  You know that's not what you promised, Jim! Now you want to shut me up!"},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker begins to whack Snake's leg with his cane.

He had a heart attack or something."},{"character":"Baker","line":"A heart attack? Oh, don't be a fool."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Anyway, the terrorists have both codes now."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Those boys are totally insane.  They wouldn't hesitate to launch."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I agree.  But what do they really want?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Who knows.  Maybe they're like us in the arms industry... always looking forward to the next good war."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well I'm not going to let these maniacs start a war toady.  Do you still have the card keys."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Card keys?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"To override tge detonation codes!  I heard you had them..."},{"character":"Baker","line":"No, not anymore."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What!?  Who does then!?  Not the terrorists!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"No, that woman."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Woman!?  Who!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"A soldier that was thrown in prison along with me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female soldier?  It must be..."},{"character":"Baker","line":"She said that she had just joined up as a new recruit.  She said they threw her in prison because she refused to take part in the rebellion."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A new recruit?  Could that be the Colonel's niece!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I gave her the key.  Looks like she managed to break out of here though. I hope she's okay."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sure she is.  She's green... but as tough as they come.  But how did you know she escaped?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"I was in contact with her by Codec.  Until I was tied up here that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Codec?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  She stole it from the guard.  If she still has it, you should be able to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm sure she still has it.  What frequency was she at?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh yeah.  Let me tell you.  It's..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker is struggling to remember.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Huh?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...Oh... sorry... I forgot..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Oh that's right!  It should be on the back of the CD case.  Try to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll contact her right away.  But tell me... If this doesn't work, is there some other way to prevent the missile launch?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Hmmm.  You need to find Hal Emmerich, one of my employees."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The team leader of the Metal Gear Rex project.  A genius at engineering, but a little bit of an oddball.  If there is anyone who can figure out how to stop Metal Gear from launching, it's him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What if he can't come up with anything?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You'll have to destroy it.  Emmerich knows how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where is this Emmerich?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Well... he's probably being held somewhere in the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building.  It's north from here.  That's where he worked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, but... why Metal Gear?  The Nuclear Age ended with the turn of the millenium."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You're wrong.  The threat of nuclear war isn't gone... in fact it's greater than it's ever been."},{"character":"action","line":"(Scenes of missile launches, storage buildings, and missile silos are shown.)"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The amount of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium is increasing even today.  Listen, have you ever seen a warehouse full of nuclear material?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...No."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Drums and drums of nuclear waste stacked this high.  As far as you can see because there's still no real way to dispose of the stuff."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they just close the lid and pretend like it'll go away?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Essentially, yes.  And they're not even doing a good job of storing it.  Many of the drums are corroded... with nuclear waste seeping out of them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Unbelievable."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Not only that, several pounds of MUF are reported every year."},{"character":"Snake","line":"MUF?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"It stands for \"material unnacounted for\". It proves that there is a large and well organized black market in nuclear materials. Furthermore, since the end of the Cold War, Russian nuclear engineers, in particular, are out of work with nowhere to turn."},{"character":"action","line":"(We go back to the chamber where Snake and Baker are conversing.)"},{"character":"Baker","line":"In other words, there is plenty of nuclear material and scientists for making a bomb.  We live in an age when any small country can have a nuclear weapons program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about the other superpowers?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Russia and China still maintain a signifigant nuclear presence. Complete nuclear disarmament is an impossibility.  To maintain our own policy of deterrance, we need a weapon of overwhelming power."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean Metal Gear."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You know our industry suffered quite a blow as a result of the cut-backs in military budgets, due to this so called \"peace\"."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember hearing a lot about mergers and take-overs among the big weapons makers."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  And after my company lost their bid to produce the Air Force's next fighter jet, the Metal Gear project was out last ace in the hole.  That's why we pushed to have Metal Gear developed as a black project."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Black project?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Secret projects paid for by the Pentagon's black budget.  You can avoid a lot of red tape a get a great lead-time on your weapons production.  And no one can bother you.  Not even those bleeding heart liberals on the military oversight committee."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Bribes."},{"character":"Baker","line":"I prefer to think of it as good buisness.  Anyway, Metal Gear was going to be formally adopted after the results of this exercise were analyzed."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't give a crap about you and your company."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes, that's about what I'd expect from a grunt like you... Here, this is what you came for, right?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker fishes a disc out of his pocket and hands it to Snake.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"An optical disk.  It's all here.  The main hard drive was destroyed by gunfire.  This is the only remaining copy of the data."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What kind of data?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"All the data collected from this exercise.  Don't play dumb.  I know you were sent to get this.  I hid it from that sadistic maniac while he was torturing me.  They don't know that this disk exists. Make sure that you report this to Jim... to your boss.  I'll give you my card too.  It'll open up all level two security doors."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Can you walk?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...No ...You go on without me.  They got my password... they don't want anything else from me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have one more question.  Who or what was that ninja thing?  It looked like you knew something."},{"character":"Baker","line":"That ninja?  That was FOX-HOUND's dark little secret."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Dark little secret?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"An experimantal... genome... soldier..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker coughs once more.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You know him?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You should ask Dr. Naomi Hunter from FOX-HOUND.  She knows better than I."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"You've got to stop them.  If it goes public, my company and I are... finished."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?  Doesn't Metal Gear use currently existing technology?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Metal Gear itself does, but..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker bends over in pain.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Huh!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"What... what did you do to me!?  Uh... oooh...no!  ...Ooh.  Oh no, it can't be! ...those Pentagon bastards!  ...So they...they actually went ahead and did it!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"They... they're just... using you for... uuuhhh..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Baker slumps over and Snake stands in front of him stunned and confused.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What the hell?"},{"character":"action","line":"(After thinking for a moment he calls Campbell on the Codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel!  Are you listening?  Now he's dead too!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"...I have no idea!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't lie to me!"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It looked like another heart attcak but..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Some kind of poison!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well, there are a lot of drugs that can cause a heart attack in large doses.  For example. potassium chloride or dioxides... But... we won't be able to tell without doing an autopsy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I want you and Meryl to work together!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Can I trust her?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"...More than you can trust me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Get in contact with her."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Snake, there is a lot of electrical interferance coming from there. It should be okay if you do burst transmission like us but normal transmission is probably impossible.  Try moving away from that area."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, get a hold of yourself."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi, what the hell was that ninja thing?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"....."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A member of FOX-HOUND?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"No..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Are you sure?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes, we have no one like that in our unit."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Is that right?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I'm counting on you."},{"character":"action","line":"(The transmission ends and Snake is left to find Meryl's Codec frequency.  He does find it on the back of the CD case and contacts her.)"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Who are you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was really impressed with the way you busted yourself out of there."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"The one from the prison?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're the Colonel's niece, Meryl, right?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"....No... it's not him... Just exactly who are you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm the fool that your uncle sent all alone into the middle of this whole mess."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You came by yourself?  You think you're some kind of one-man army? You're not even armed."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I appreciate your help from before.  But... I don't need lectures. You're just like your uncle, you know."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"How do you know my uncle?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"We go way back."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"What's your name?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"My name's not important."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Aha!  Could you be Snake?  Are you Solid Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"That's what some people called me."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"The legendary Solid Snake...!  You!?  Sorry about before.  I wasn't sure if you were one of the good guys."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But I knew you were."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"How?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It's your eyes."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"My eyes?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"They're not soldiers eyes."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"They're rookie's eyes, right?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, they're beautiful compassionate eyes."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Just what I'd expect from the legendary Solid Snake.  You trying to sweep me off my feet?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't worry.  You'll land back on them once you meet me.  The reality is no match for the legend, I'm afraid."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I don't believe that."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why did you look surprised when you saw my face?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Because you look just like him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...You mean the terrorists leader, Liquid Snake?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Yeah, you know him?  You're not brothers are you!?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have no family."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"So, what's the deal then?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who knows.  Why don't you ask him?  But first I want some information.  You were involved in this excercise from the beginning. What exactly happened here?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I'm sorry.  I was captured along with President Baker right after the terrorist attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That's okay.  But what is this place?  I don't think it is just a nuclear wepaons disposal facility..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Boy oh boy... it's just like them!  Nobody told you anything, did they?  Okay... you see, this place isn't really for disposing nuclear weapons.  This base is owned and operated by a dummy corporation of ArmsTech."},{"character":"Snake","line":"This is a civilian base?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Right.  For the development of Metal Gear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel!"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"FOX-HOUND and the Next-Generation Special Forces were called here for the test launching of a dummy nuclear warhead."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why FOX-HOUND?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Because they're a Special Ops group used to handling top secret missions.  They figured they could keep it all hush-hush."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But we must have fired nuclear warheads before.  Why just this time?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I heard it was because this was to be a final test before the formal adoption of the Metal Gear program... that's what I heard anyway."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Hmmm... sounds kind of fishy...  So what do you think the terrorists want?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Sorry, I'm not sure.  I was captured with President Baker right after the revolt started."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh yeah, that's when he gave you the detonation override keys, right?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"That's right."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Amazing you were able to keep 'em hidden from the guards."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Well... women have more hiding places than men.  Anyway, you met up with Baker, huh?  How's he holding up?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"He's dead..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"What!?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Heart attack.  Same as the DARPA Chief."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"The Chief died from a heart attck too?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah, was either of them sick or anything?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"No, not that I heard of."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well, I don't believe in coincidences.  Something funny's going on."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Hmmm.  Sounds like it. But I have no idea what."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Me neither... yet.  Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You mean Dr. emmerich?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yes.  Is he still alive?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Probably.  he should be in the second floor basemant of the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building to the north."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Second floor basement?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Yeah, that's where his lab is.  I think they're forcing him to work on the nuclear launching program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Then we'd better do something before he finishes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You're right.  In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"You plan to take that thing on by yourself, Snake?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It won't be the first time..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"........."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the best way to get to the building where the Doctor is being held?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"There's a cargo door on the first floor of this building that leads to the north."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the security level of the door there?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Five, but it's okay... I've got a level five card."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well, I've got to go save the Doctor.  You should go..."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I'm going with you!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No way!  You're still too green.

Good luck doesn't last forever!"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I don't know what happened.  I just couldn't pull the trigger right away.  I never had any problems in training... But when I thought about my bullets tearing through those soldiers' bodies, I hesitated."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Shooting at targets and shooting at living, breathing people are different."},{"character":"Meryl","line":"Ever since I was a little girl, I always dreamed of being a soldier.  Every day of my life, I've trained my mind and my body for the one day when I could finally see some real action, and now"},{"character":"Snake","line":"So what now?  You wanna quit?"},{"character":"Meryl","line":"I can't quit.  I can't alow myself to quit now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Listen, Meryl.  Everybody feels sick the first time they kill someone.

You telling me I didn't know?"},{"character":"Emmerich","line":"They're going to put a nuclear missile into Metal Gear's TMD missile module?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Wrong.

It uses magnets to fire bullets at extremely high velocities.  The technology was originally developed for the SDI system and later scrapped.  We were successful in miniaturizing it in a joint venture between ArmsTech and Rivermore National Labs. The rail gun is on Rex's right arm."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Metal Gear's main funtion is to launch nuclear missiles.

But are you saying it was originally meant to carry nuclear missiles?"},{"character":"action","line":"(We are now back in the lab where Otacon and Snake are talking.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah, but that's not all I think.

They would need actual launch data."},{"character":"action","line":"(We are back in the lab.  Emmerich shows Snake some of the supercomputers used to do the testing)"},{"character":"Emmerich","line":"These are some of the supercomputers.  If you link these you can test everything in a virtual environment.

You better hurry. If they were planning a launch from the start, then their ballistic program is probably finished.  And since they haven't called for me in a few hours, they must not need me.  In other words, they must be ready to launch."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Meryl's got the detonation override keys.  We'll link up with her."},{"character":"Emmerich","line":"If we can't override the launch we'll have to destroy Rex."},{"character":"action","line":"(Back in the lab.)"},{"character":"Emmerich","line":"I'll show you the way."},{"character":"action","line":"(Emmerich makes to walk away but Snake stops him.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"On that leg of yours?

War is no reason to end a friendship."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's insane."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I first met him on the battlefield.  He was being held a prisoner of Outer Heaven.

I was still green and he showed me the ropes."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You knew him well?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No.  We never talked about our personal lives.

Why did you get into genetic research anyway?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I never knew who my parents were or even what they looked like. I guess I got into genetics because I wanted to figure out why I'm the way I am."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So you studied about DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yeah.  I thought if I studied my genetic structure, I'd find out who I really was.  I thought that by analyzing a person's genetic information, I could retrieve the blank spots in that person's memory."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Memory is stored in DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"We're not sure.

That's incredible, Snake!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Listen. I just want to make sure again.  This is the way to get to where Metal Gear is being stored?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah. The entrance to the underground maintenance base is towards the back of the snowfield ahead."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay. Find a safe place to hide out for a while.  I'm going underground."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"I know, I know. You don't have to tell me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And stay outta my way.

This isn't first grade math class."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"I thought I'd get one for you, so I went back to the lab and..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"The four suits were missing."},{"character":"Snake","line":".........?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Also...about the elevator that I checked out...

Just as I thought, the nuclear warhead is designed to be fired from the rail gun, like a projectile... It doesn't use fuel so it isn't considered a missile. That way it can get around all sorts of international treaties."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Pretty sneaky."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yes, but effective.  And that's not even the scariest thing about this weapon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't wait to hear this."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"It's a stealth weapon!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean it won't show up on radar?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah.  The truth is... they've been working on a stealth missile since the late 70's."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why weren't they able to develope one until now?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Because of the missile's rocket propulsion system... it will be picked up by enemy satellites."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh yeah, that makes sense."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"But unlike a missile, the rail gun doesn't burn any propellant.  So it can't be detected by any current ballistic missile detection systems."},{"character":"Snake","line":"An invisible nuclear warhead..."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Totally impossible to intercept.  And on top of that, it's got a surface piercing warhead designed to penetrate hardened underground bases."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We learned that lesson in the Gulf War."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"This thing could mean the end of the world!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It's the ultimate weapon.  And from a political point of view, it avoids the problem of nuclear reduction and nuclear inspections. Colonel, is this true?  Are you listening?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm listening..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If word of this got out, it could delay the signing of the Start 3 Treaty and cause a huge international incident."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah, it would be nasty.  The United States would be denounced by the UN... it could even bring the President down..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did you know this, Colonel?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You've changed, Colonel."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I won't make any excuses..."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Snake, listen to me.  This new nuclear weapon... it's never actually been tested, only simulated."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean they ran a computer model?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah, that's why they were conducting this excercise.  They needed to get actual data to back up the simulation."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What were the results of the excercise?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"It looks like it went better than they hoped for.  But...I can't find the data anywhere on this network.  You'd think that data as important as that would be carefully recorded..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"It was.  President Baker gave me an optical disc with all of the test data."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"What!? Do you still have it?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, Ocelot took it from me."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Damn..."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"The terrorists have replaced the dummy warhead with a real warhead. Once they input the detonation codes, they should be ready to launch."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So you think they can do it?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Well the dummy warhead was designed to be identical to the real thing, so I think so."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did you find out how to override it yet?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Not yet.  It must be in a separate file.  Right now, I'm looking through all of Baker's personal files."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We're counting on you..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake enters the control center of the Rex hangar.  He sees Liquid and Ocelot talking.)"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Okay. I've entered the PAL codes and disengaged the safety device.

The new target is...Lopnor, China."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Why Boss?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"I'm sure neither you nor Mr. Gurlukovich would really like to see a nuclear bomb dropped on your Motherland, right?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid!"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"But why? There's nothing there."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Wrong. It's a nuclear test site."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"A nuclear test site?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"If we nuke a major population center, the game's over... But a nuclear explosion at a test site can still be concealed from the public. Meanwhile Washington will be worried about the retaliatory strike from China."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"That'll probably mean top secret talks between both countries' leaders..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Of course. And in the process, the President will be forced to divulge the existence of a new and highly destabilizing nuclear weapon to the Chinese. What do you think that will do to the U.S.'s reputation? Or the President's?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"And with the CTBT, that means that China and India... I see..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Yes. When the other countries hear about this new weapon, they'll all want to contact us. Washington won't be very happy when we start selling their own system to the highest bidders. Yes. The President will break. He will give in to our demands."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Big Boss's DNA and one billion dollars..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One billion dollars!"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"That money will be used to cure our genome soldiers as well. I'm also including the FoxDie vaccine in our demands."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"FoxDie... It killed Octopus and the ArmsTech president... So it's true that it affects older people first. Mantis might not have been affected because he wore a mask."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Wolf wasn't infected either. Perhaps due to those tranquilizers she always took."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Something to do with the adrenaline level in the blood? Or maybe it's just because this FoxDie was still experimental and they haven't worked out all the bugs yet..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"In any case, have you heard from your friend, Colonel Sergei Gurlukovich at the Spetznaz?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"He still has doubts about the ability of Metal Gear. He said we can talk after Metal Gear's test launch is successful."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"He is a very prudent man."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"There's nothing to worry about. The Colonel wants Metal Gear and the new nuclear weapon so bad he can taste it. If Russia wants to regain its position as a military superpower, they need to reinforce their nuclear arsenal. They need a nuclear weapon that can't be intercepted. Metal Gear will allow them to gain first strike capability over the rest of the world."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Their regular army is in shambles and they think they can restore their country's military power with nuclear weapons? Gurlukovich... he's no warrior... he is a politician."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"But he's the one who gave us the Hind and most of our other heavy firepower."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"He's got over a thousand soldiers under his command. If we joined forces we could put up quite a resistance here. Since Mantis died, the genome soldiers' brainwashing has started to wear off. I'm worried about the men's morale. An alliance with the Russians would boost that as well..."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"What are you saying?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"We're not going anywhere. We're going to dig in here."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"We could still escape..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"We've got the most powerful weapon ever made and we're about to ally with Gurlukovich's forces."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Are you going to fight the whole world?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"And what's wrong with that? We can launch a nuclear warhead at any target on this planet... A nuclear warhead invisible to radar. And on top of that, this base is full of spare nuclear warheads. Once we get the DNA and the money, the world will be ours!"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"What about your promise to Colonel Gurlukovich?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"I have no interest in the revival of Mother Russia."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"...You're not thinking of reviving Big Boss's dream?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"From today, ...call this place \"Outer Heaven\"."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Big Boss's dream..."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"But Boss,... you're not worried about the PAL being overridden? If the code is entered again, it'll be deactivated."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"No need to worry. The DARPA Chief and the ArmsTech president are both dead."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Does Snake know how the override system works?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"You interrogated him. Don't you know?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"He didn't have any keys on him."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Good. Then no one can stop Metal Gear now."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"By the way, what should we do with that woman? Want me to kill her?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Let her live. She's Campbell's niece and Snake cares for her... We'll keep her as our ace in-the-hole."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Meryl... she's alive."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Snake, I found Baker's top-secret files!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Great job."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"How's it going there?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"They've finished inputting the PAL codes. So how do we deactivate them?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Okay...y'see the override system that the president was talking about... It can also be used to input the detonation codes. Y'see if you insert the keys when the warhead is active, you deactivate it. And if you insert them when it's inactive, it becomes activated. And you can only use the keys once."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Only once, huh."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah...you'd better get started. We don't have much time."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But it takes three keys, right!? I've only got one of them!"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Hold on a minute. Y'see that's the trick. You already have all three keys!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"The card key is made of a shape memory alloy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Shape memory alloy?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yes. It's a material that changes shape at different temperatures. The key is made out of it!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"This card key?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah. The card key changes shape at different temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So this key is actually three keys in one...clever."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Can you see the input terminals in the center of the Control Room..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I see them."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Those three laptop terminals are for the emergency input. There should be a symbol on each screen... Each symbol corresponds to a different key. Input the keys in order from left to right. The left one's for the room temperature key. See the symbol? Next to that goes the low temperature key. The one on the right is the high temperature key."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, I got it. First I change the shape of the card and then I input them in order, right?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"That's right. All you do is insert the card keys. After you insert the key into the module, a hard disk reads the information contained on it. Once you've finished with all three terminals, the code input process is complete. But here's the thing. You can only use the key three times. It's an emergency system and it's only meant to be used once."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The world is riding on that key, Snake."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Who's that!!"},{"character":"action","line":"(Ocelot fires a bullet at Snake.  Snake is startled and loses his grip on the key.  It tumbles over the railing and falls into the drainage ditch.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!! The key fell in the drainage ditch!"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Snake!! This is bullet-proof glass! There's no way in! I'll enjoy watching you die!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, you've got to get that key!"},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake finds the key and heads back up to the control room to input the code.)"},{"character":"Computer","line":"PAL code number one confirmed. Awaiting PAL code number two..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, that takes care of PAL code number one... Now PAL number two... freeze the key."},{"character":"Computer","line":"PAL code number two confirmed. Awaiting PAL code number three..."},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake. It's about Naomi Hunter..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Then you should talk to the Colonel. He's looking into it."},{"character":"Master","line":"Turn your monitor off."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay it's off. No one else can hear us. Go ahead."},{"character":"Master","line":"Sorry, but I didn't want the Colonel to hear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, so what's up?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I've got a good friend in the Pentagon..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah..."},{"character":"Master","line":"He's the one who told me about it... It looks like the DIA recently developed a new type of assassination weapon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"An assassination weapon?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake, have you ever heard of something called \"Fox Die\"?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No..."},{"character":"Master","line":"Fox Die?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...Liquid and others were talking about it..."},{"character":"Master","line":"Yeah. It's some kind of virus that targets specific people. I don't know all the details, but..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you trying to say?"},{"character":"Master","line":"It's too similar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What is!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"The cause of death. Didn't the ArmsTech president and the DARPA Chief, I mean Decoy Octopus,... die of something that looked like a heart attack?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah...?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Well, apparently Fox Die kills its victims by simulating a heart attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No... You're telling me that Naomi was behind it?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake, try to remember. Did Naomi give you some kind of injection?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...The nanomachines."},{"character":"Master","line":"She was in the best position to have done it, but I don't know what her motive was."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...Does the Colonel know?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I'm not sure. But he still hasn't questioned her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay. I'll ask him myself. Colonel, what's new with the Naomi situation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I just placed Naomi under arrest."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Arrest?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She was sending coded messages towards the Alaskan base. I didn't want to believe it, but she must be working with the terrorists."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Are you sure?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. She's being interrogated now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What kind of interrogation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well...I'd like to avoid the rough stuff, but we don't even have any sodium pentathol here."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Call me if you find out anything."},{"character":"Master","line":"So it's true, isn't it?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi...I can't believe it."},{"character":"Master","line":"That means the Fox Die vaccine must be around somewhere."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Listen. I've got bigger things to worry about."},{"character":"Master","line":"But Snake...you might be infected too, you know."},{"character":"Snake","line":"All I can do is leave it up to the Colonel."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake goes to input the rest of the PAL Codes and during the process he gets a Codec call.)"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Snake, can you hear me?  It's Naomi..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi!? ...what the hell!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Campbell and the others are busy right now...I'm on a different Codec."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi, is what the Colonel says true?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...Yes.  But not everything I said was a lie. I don't know myself. I don't know my real name or even what my parents looked like.  I bought all my identification. But my reason for getting into genetics was true."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Cause you want to know yourself, right?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right. I want to know where I came from...m...my age, my race... anything."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I was found in Rhodesia sometime in the 80's... a dirty little orphan..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Rhodesia? What's now known as Zimbabwe?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. Rhodesia was owned by England until 1965 and there were lots of Indian laborers around.  That's probably where I got my skin color from, but I'm not even sure about that..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi, you're too worried about the past. Isn't it enough to understand who you are now?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Understand who I am now!?  Why should I? No one else tries to understand me.  I was alone for so long... until I met my big brother and him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Your big brother?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes.... Frank Jaeger."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"He was a young soldier, when he picked me up near the Zambezi River.  I was half-dead from starvation and he shared his rations with me."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. Frank Jaeger, the man who you destroyed, was my brother and my only family."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Gray Fox?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"We survived that hell together, Frank and I.  He protected me. He's my one connection... the only connection that I have to my past."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And he brought you back to America?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"No.  I was in Mozambique when \"he\" came."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who is \"he\" ? ...You mean Big Boss?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"He brought us to this land of freedom , this America. But then he and my brother went back to Africa to continue the war.  And that's when it happened... You killed my benefactor and sent my brother home a cripple.  I vowed revenge and joined FOX-HOUND.  I knew it was my best chance to meet you and I prayed for the day that I ould..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So were your prayers answered?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. I waited two long years..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"To kill me?  Is that all you cared about?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. That's right.  Two years.  You were all I thought about for two long years...like some kind of twisted obsession..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do you still hate me?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...Not exactly.  I was partly wrong about you..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about Liquid and the others?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"No. I'll have my revenge on them too."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi...you didn't kill that doctor too, did you?  The one that used Gray Fox for his genome experiments..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...No...that was my brother.  Afterwards I covered it up and helped him hide out..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So that Ninja...I mean Gray Fox... he's come here to kill me?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...I don't think so.  I think he just came here to fight you... I wasn't sure before, but now I think I understand.  A final battle with you... that's all he lives for. I'm sure of it..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...Fox...no... Naomi, tell me something..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...about FoxDie?  FoxDie is a type of retrovirus that targets and kills only specific people.  First, it infects the macrophages in the victim's body.  FoxDie contains smart enzymes, created through protein engineering.  They're programmed to respond to specific genetic patterns in the cells."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Those enzymes recognize the target's DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Right. They respond by becoming active, and using the macrophages, they begin creating TNF epsilon.  It's a type of cytokine, a peptide which causes cells to die.  The TNF epsilon is carried along the bloodstream to the heart, where they attach to the TNF receptors in the heart cells."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And then...they cause a heart attack?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The heart cells suffer a shock and undergo an extreme apoptosis. Then... the victim dies."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Apoptosis...you mean the heart cells commit suicide... Naomi..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...What?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...You must have programmed that thing to kill me too, right? Do I still have time? Naomi, I don't blame you for wanting me dead.  But I can't go yet. I still have a job to do."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Listen, Snake.  I'm not the one who made the decision to use FoxDie."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You weren't?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You were injected with FoxDie as a part of this operation. I just wanted to let you know that... No, that's not the whole truth... the real thing that I wanted to tell you was... Snake, I... I..."},{"character":"Voice","line":"Hey! What are you doing!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Eeeek!!  Ooooh.... Snake....."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"...Snake, I can't allow Naomi to make any more unauthorized transmissions.  Naomi's been removed from this operation."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What happened to Naomi!? What did she mean when she said that FoxDie was a part of this operation!?  Colonel, let me talk to her!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I won't. She's under arrest."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...you double crossed me!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, there's no time for that!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Right now your job is to stop Metal Gear! ...Okay, Snake!?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake inputs the second PAL code.)"},{"character":"Computer","line":"PAL code number two conirmed.  Awaiting PAL code number three."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, there goes PAL code number two. Next comes PAL number three... warm the key."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake Inputs the third PAL code.)"},{"character":"Computer","line":"PAL code number three confirmed. PAL code entry complete... Detonation code activated."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No! Why!"},{"character":"Computer","line":"Ready for launch..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake recieves a Codec call from Master Miller.)"},{"character":"Master","line":"Thank you Snake.  Now the detonation code is completed. Nothing can stop Metal Gear now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Master, what's going on?"},{"character":"Master","line":"You found the key and even activated the warhead for us too. I really must express my gratitude.  Sorry to have involved you in that silly shape memory alloy business.  We weren't able to learn the DARPA Chief's code.  Even with Mantis' psychic powers, he couldn't read his mind.  Then Ocelot accidentally killed him during the interrogation.  In other words, we weren't able to launch the nuclear device and we were all getting a little worried.  Without the threat of a nuclear strike, our demands would never be met."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you mean?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Without the detonation codes, we had to find some other way. That's when we decided...you might prove useful, Snake.  First I thought we might get the information from you, Snake.  So I had Decoy Octopus disguise himself as the DARPA Chief.  Unfortunately Octopus didn't survive the encounter. ...thanks to FoxDie."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean you had this planned from the beginning? Just to get me to input the detonation code!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Huh? You didn't think you made it this far by yourself, did you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who the hell are you!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"In any case, the launch preparations are complete.  Once the world glimpses the power of this weapon, the White House will have no choice but to surrender the FoxDie vaccine to me. Their ace-in-the- hole is useless now..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Ace-in-the-hole?"},{"character":"Master","line":"The Pentagon's plan to use you was already successful... in the torture room."},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake, you're the only one who doesn't know.  Poor fool."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who are you anyway!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I'll tell you everything you want to know.

He's been dead for at least three days.  I didn't know because my Codec link with Master was cut off.  But Mei Ling said his transmission signal was coming from inside the base!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"So who is it?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, you've been talking to..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"...Me... dear brother."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid!? How the...!?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"You've served your purpose.

You'd point a weapon at your own brother?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why did you disguise yourself as Master?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"So I could manipulate you more easily. And you performed quite well I must say. Although the boys at the Pentagon are probably saying the same thing..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What the hell are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Following orders blindly with no questions asked. You've lost your warrior's pride and become nothing more than a pawn, Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Stopping the nuclear launch, rescuing the hostages... It was all just a diversion."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A diversion?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"The Pentagon only needed for you to come into contact with us. That's what killed the ArmsTech president and Decoy Octopus."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You don't mean..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"That's right. You were sent in here to kill us so they could retrieve Metal Gear undamaged along with the bodies of the genome soldiers. From the beginning, the Pentagon was just using you as a vector to spread FoxDie!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Fox Die! ...It can't be! Are you telling me Naomi was working with the Pentagon?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"They thought she was. But it seems that Dr. Naomi Hunter couldn't be controlled so easily."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"We've got a spy working in the Pentagon. He reported that Dr. Hunter altered FoxDie's program just before the operation. But...no one knows how or why."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I wonder... maybe they arrested her so they could find out the answer to that."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"No doubt. But I had no idea she was motivated by such petty revenge... we still don't know what changes she made to FoxDie's program. Oh well. It doesn't matter. I've already added the FoxDie vaccine to my list of White House demands."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's a vaccine?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"There must be. But that woman is the only one who really knows. Anyway, it might prove to be unnecessary."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why is that?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"You were successful in coming into contact with all of us, so we must have all been exposed to the virus. It's true that the ArmsTech president and Decoy Octopus were killed by FoxDie... But Ocelot, myself, and you, the carrier, were apparently unaffected."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A bug in the virus' programming?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Hmm, could be. In any case, if it doesn't kill you then I'm not worried either. After all, our genetic code is identical."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So it's true...you and I are..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Yes, twins, but we're not ordinary twins... we're twins linked by cursed genes. Les enfants terribles. You're fine. You got all the old man's dominant genes. I got all the flawed, recessive genes. Everything was done so that you would be the greatest of his children. The only reason I exist is so they could create you."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was the favorite, huh."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"That's right! I'm just the leftovers of what they used to make you. Can you understand what it's like to know that you're garbage since the day you were born!?

With all the liars and hypocrites running the world, war isn't what it used to be... We're losing our place in a world that no longer needs us. A world that now spurns our very existence. You should know that as well as I do. After I launch this weapon and get our billion dollars, we'll be able to bring chaos and honor... back to this world gone soft.

I haven't even said whether I'd accept this mission."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well you can make up your mind after you hear more about the situation."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about the nuclear weapons disposal facility."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The disposal facility includes a hardened underground base. Even with our most advanced intelligence gathering equipment, we can't tell what's happening inside."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So someone needs to penetrate, gather intelligence, and report back... Sounds like a spy movie. What's the insertion method?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well an air insertion is impossible."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Not with this storm going on."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll approach the disposal facility by sub."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Approach?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, within a few miles of it. The facility is equipped with sonar detection capability. They'd be able to hear our engine or propeller noise."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And then?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll launch a one-man SDV (swimmer delivery vehicle)."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Launch?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Same as a torpedo. Only this has no propulsion device of its own. After the SDV gets as close as it can, dispose of it. From there on you'll have to swim."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You want me to swim in sub-zero Alaskan water?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry. That suit represents the latest advances in poly- thermal technology. The nuclear weapons disposal facility covers the whole island. I'll contact you by Codec after you reach your target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Anyone going with me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"As usual, this is a one-man inflitration mission."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Weapons and equipment OSP (on-site procurement)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. This a top-secret black op. Don't expect any official support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Chief of DARPA and the president of an arms manufacturing company... what business did they have at a nuclear weapons disposal facility?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The truth is that secret exercises were being conducted at the time the terrorist group attacked."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Must be extremely important exercises if those two were directly involved. Were they testing some kind of new advanced weapon?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not privy to that information."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do we know exactly where they're being held?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The DARPA chief has also been injected with a mini-transmitter. As you get closer you should be able to pick up his location on your radar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do they really have the ability to launch a nuclear missile?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They say they do. They even gave us the serial number of the warhead they plan to use."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was the number confirmed?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. At the very least, they've got their hands on a real nuclear warhead."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Isn't there some kind of safety device to prevent this kind of terrorism?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. Every missile and warhead in our arsenal is equipped with a PAL, which uses a discreet detonation code."},{"character":"Snake","line":"PAL?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Permissive Action Link. A safety control system built into all nuclear weapons systems. But even so, we can't rest easy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why not?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because the DARPA Chief knows the detonation code."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But even if they have a nuclear warhead, it must've been removed from its missile. All the missiles on these disposal sites are supposed to be dismantled. It's not that easy to get your hands on an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missle)."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That used to be true, but since the end of the Cold War you can get anything if you have enough money and the right connections."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So what exactly are they demanding?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"A person's remains."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Remains?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's right. To be more accurate, cell specimens which contain the individual's genomic information."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Cell specimens? Why would they want that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The terrorists need them. You see these Next-Generation Special Forces have been strengthened through gene therapy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Strengthened?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You've heard of the Human Genome Project. They've been mapping the human genome, and they're nearly finished. Following up on this research, the military has been working towards identifiying those genes which are responsible for making effective soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There are genes that do that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and using gene therapy they're able to transplant those genes into regular soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Gene therapy?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I'll explain this part. With gene therapy, we can remove those genes which we know may lead to sickness or disease, and that the same time, splice in genes with beneficial effects such as resistance to cancer for example."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"In other words, we can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases and at the same time add genetic characteristics as desired."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, and so if you knew what genes were responsible for making the perfect soldier, you could implant them in the same way, right?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes we could."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But it all depends on being able to isolate and identify those \"soldier genes\"."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"And in order to do that, it's helpful to study the genomic information of one of the greatest soldiers ever."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One of the greatest soldiers ever?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The man they call the greatest warrior of the twentieth century."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You don't mean Big Boss?!"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right. We've been working feverishly to identify the genes responsible for his incredible combat skill. So far we've discovered about sixty of the so-called \"soldier genes.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"So his body was recovered after all."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, and his cells have remained frozen in cryo-chamber. His genomic information is a priceless treasure to mankind."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Priceless to the military perhaps."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"His body was burned severely, but it was possible to restore his DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) profile from just a single strand of his hair."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You people are amazing. And then you're going to transplant those genes into soldiers?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. We'll use a process that I discovered called gene targeting. The strongest soldiers don't become what they are by acquiring their skills through training or experience, we now know that hereditary factors are far more crucial for creating superior soldiers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, we can't give them his body. It's potentially more dangerous than all the warheads on that island put together."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I hear the terrorists are calling themselves the \"Sons of Big Boss.\""},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's the time limit?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"24 hours. They say they'll launch after 24 hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did they say what the target will be?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"So far they haven't mentioned a target."},{"character":"Snake","line":"When did the countdown start?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"5 hours ago."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, who are you speaking for?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Naturally, I'm representing the US government."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So who's in supervisory control of this operation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The President of the United States."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Which means that the President must be meeting with his top aides in the map room about now, huh?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No at this point they're still video conferencing with each other."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If that's a real nuclear warhead, shouldn't they issue a COG (Continuity of Government)?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Not yet. The Secretary of Defense has operational control and is fully aware of the situation. After you infiltrate, if you determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities a COG will be issued."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Well if they haven't relocated to nuclear shelter under Mount Washingtion, I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet. Is the National Security Agency in on this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes. So is the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The DIA? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They'll be sending us some support."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We don't need desk jockies. We need a nuclear weapons specialist."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Of course. A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned to us."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We need backup from a specialist. I'm just an amateur when it comes to nuclear weapons."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I know. That's why I've requested the assistance of a military analyst named Nastasha Romanenko. She'll be providing you backup by Codec."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A female analyst?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's built up an impressive record as an advisor to the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Contact her if you have any questions. She's also an expert on hi-tech weapons."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Where's she working from?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"At her home in Los Angeles."},{"character":"Snake","line":"California. Seems like a million miles away."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How well-armed are these terrorists? I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They're heavily armed I'm afraid."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about they're battle experience."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The six members of FOX-HOUND in charge are all hardened veterans. They're tough enough to eat nails and ask for seconds."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The others are Next-Generation Special Forces. They're not your average grunts either."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"They started out as an anti-terrorist special-ops unit made up of members from former biochem units, technical escort units, and the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Their purpose was to respond to threats involving next-generation weapons of mass destruction, including NBC (nuclear/biological/chemica) weapons."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Until \"they\" were added that is."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's \"they\"?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"These guys didn't start out as regular army."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a pretty international group. Mercenaries?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yeah. And it gets worse. Most of them were from a merc agency that I think you're familiar with. They were part of Big Boss' private guard. And after Big Boss went down, the military just bought out all their contracts."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Outer Heaven."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"After that they were merged with our own VR unit, Force 21, and re-trained. If you ask me, these so-called \"Next-Generation Special Forces\" should to be called \"simulated soldiers.\" They have no real battle experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Video game players, huh?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy. They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers. Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by international law."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes, but those are just declarations not actual treaties."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit conspired in this attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"They're calling it a revolution."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Since they all went through the same gene therapy, they probably felt closer than brothers. They see the unit as their only family."},{"character":"Snake","line":"The Sons of Big Boss. But if they were regular army, they must've been interviewed periodically by army counsellers."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"According to their files, they all got straight A's on their psychological tests. They all seemed like fine, upstanding patriotic soldiers."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But they all took part in the uprising?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No. Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise. That's why there was a resupply of troops."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Apparently they consulted classified information about the soldier genes and performed their own gene therapy experiments."},{"character":"Snake","line":"They can do that even without you?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well our gene therapy process is almost completely automated. And besides that they're all geniuses with IQs over 180."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Even the existence of this genome army is a national secret of the highest order. We'd been hoping to investigate this quietly and deal with it behind closed doors."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Hi-Tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND. Your former unit, and one that I was a commander of. An elite group combining firepower and expertise. They're every bit as good as when I was commanding them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So they're still around."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are six members of FOX-HOUND involved in this terrorist activity. Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities. Sniper Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter. Decoy Octopus, master of disguise. Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman. And Revolver Ocelot, specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like a lovely bunch of folks. Too bad we'll be meeting under these circumstances."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"And finally, in charge of them, FOX-HOUND's squad leader Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake?!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes and you're the only person who can stand against him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid Snake."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Liquid Snake. The man with the same codename as you."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Tell me what you know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager, the youngest person in the SAS (British Special Air Service).  His job was to track down and destroy mobile SCUD missile launching platforms. You were there too I believe. Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was just a kid myself back then."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The details are classified, but it seems that originally he penetrated the the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS."},{"character":"Snake","line":"He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"But he never once showed his face in Century House. He was taken prisoner in Iraq, and after that there was no trace of him for several years. After you retired, he was rescued and became a member of FOX-HOUND."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using codenames."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know his real name. That information is so highly classified that even I can't look at it. Here's a photo of him.  Pretty shocking, huh?  His skin tone is a little different but otherwise you two are exact duplicates."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I have a twin?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I don't know the details, but it seems so. That's why we really need you for this mission."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're the only one who can beat him. Now that I've met you, I know. You've got something he doesn't. I can see it in your eyes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why don't I find that thought more comforting?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore. Let me go back to Twin Lakes."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Why Snake? Is your life in Alaska all that great?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's a dogsled race this week. Next Saturday I have to be in Anchorage."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The Iditarod? The longest sled race in the world? When did you become a dog musher?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Right now my fifty huskies are my only family. I've got to take care of them."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Don't worry about your dogs."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you mean?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry Snake but this vessel is headed for the Bering Sea. There's no room for debate."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I told you, even if I do owe you I don't anything to this army or this country!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You will accept this assignment!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why should I be stupid enough to do that? I'm no patriot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, there's enough dirt in your file from your days as an agent to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh I see. Blackmail."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"No Snake. I prefer to look at it as helping you to come to a decision more easily. But anyway, I know you better than that. You'd take this assignment even without the threat."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why do you say that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"You're a natural born soldier. You're not the grow old gracefully type. Same for all of us who've seen real action. The only place we can feel truly alive is on the battlefield. I'm a solider too. I know those feelings of powerlessness, frustration that you feel everyday. You've tried to play the boy scout out there in Alaska, but you can't race dogs in the snow forever.  Why don't you come back to us and be a soldier again."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You think my life is some kind of joke?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, I just want to give you back your purpose in life."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're retired. Why are you involved in this?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Because there aren't many people who know FOX-HOUND as well as I do."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Is that really the only reason?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've been soldiering for a long time, I don't know anything else. I guess even though I'm getting a little old, I still love to be in the field."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Colonel, you're a lousy liar. Tell me the real reason."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Okay Snake. Sorry. I'll be frank. A person very dear to me is being held hostage."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who is it?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"My niece. Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What was your niece doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt. And my niece was one of those called in as an emergency replacement."},{"character":"Snake","line":"She looks like you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She's my little brother's girl. He died in the Gulf War. Since then I've been watching after her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A personal motive, Colonel. That's not very soldierly."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm retired. I'm just an old man now. And I'm your friend."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Since when are we friends?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I've thought of us as friends since the fall of Zanzibar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"With my personality I don't have too many friends."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"That's what I trust about you. It's what makes you human. Please Snake. Save my niece Meryl."},{"character":"Snake","line":"All right, but I have two conditions."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Name them."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One, no more secrets between us. I want complete disclosure at all times and two, I'll only accept orders from you, Colonel. No cutoffs involved okay?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Agreed. That's why I was called. But one thing."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm not a colonel anymore. Just a retired old warhorse."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I understand, Colonel."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That doctor. Is she part of this operation too?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She was in charge of FOX-HOUND's gene therapy. She knows more about those men than anyone else."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean you've seen them naked?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Make no mistake. I'm not a nurse. I'm a scientist."},{"character":"Snake","line":"By the way, what was that injection for?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"It's a combination of and nanomachines and an anti-freezing peptide so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze, even at sub-arctic temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nanomachines?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Not just one kind either. There are different types which will replenish the supply of adrenaline, nutrition and sugar in your bloodstream."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Now I don't have to worry about food."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I also put some nootropics in there."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Say what?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Nootropics. It's a class of drugs which will help improve your mental functioning."},{"character":"Snake","line":"It'll make smarter huh? Anything else?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Benzedrine. It's a type of stimulant. It'll keep you alert and responsive for twelve straight hours."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That was quite a cocktail. Anything else in there?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Those nanomachines will also keep your Codec's batteries charged up."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You're welcome."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I need to borrow your scissors."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"What are you going to do?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Don't worry. Just going to clean myself up a little."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Huh?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't want to be mistaken for the leader of the terrorists."},{"character":"action","line":""},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake swims through the lower dock of the disposal facility.  We see a man riding up the cargo elevator.)"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Stay alert!  He'll be through here, I know it.  I'm going to go swat down a couple of bothersome flies."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake removes his flippers and calls Campbell on the codec.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"This is Snake.  Colonel, can you hear me?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Loud and clear Snake.  What's the situation?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Just as I expected.  You'll have to take the elevator to the surface.  But make sure that nobody sees you.  If you need to contact me by codec, the frequency is 140.85.  When you want to use the codec push the Select button. When we need to contact you the codec will beep.  When you hear that noise push the Select button. The codec directly stimulates the small bones of your ear, no one but you will be able to hear it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Got it, okay, I'm ready to go."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake takes off his scuba gear and watches the landscape slide by as the elevator ascends.  The title appears on the screen \"Metal Gear Solid\".  The elevator stops and Snake quickly runs out and looks for cover behind a storage crate.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It's Snake.  I'm in front of the disposal facility."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Excellent, Snake.  Age hasn't slowed you down one bit."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How's that Sneaking Suit working out?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm nice and dry, but it is a little hard to move."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Bear with it.  It's designed to prevent hypothermia.  This is Alaska you know."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Take it easy, I'm grateful.  If it wasn't for your suit and your shot I would have turned into a popsicle out there."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"An anti-freezing peptide Snake.  All of the Genome soldiers in this exercise are using it."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm relieved to hear that.  Already tested, huh?  By the way, how's the diversionary operation going?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.  The terrorist's radar should have picked them up by now."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake peers out from behind the crate and sees a group of terrorists by a helicopter.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"A Hind D?  Colonel, what's a Russian gunship doing here?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I have no idea...but it looks like our little diversion got their attention.  Now's your best chance to slip in unnoticed."},{"character":"action","line":"(The helicopter takes off, throwing snow in all directions, the guards on the ground shield their eyes as they follow it up into the sky.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There are only 18 hours left until their deadline.  You've got to hurry."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Wow...you must be crazy to fly a Hind in this kind of weather."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Oh sorry, I haven't introduced you two yet.  This is Mei Ling.  She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist. She designed your codec, as well as your Soliton radar system. Contact her if you have any questions about either of them."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Nice to meet you Snake.  It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself."},{"character":"Snake","line":"......"},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"What's wrong?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Nothing...I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so...cute."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"You're just flattering me..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, I'm serious.  Now I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"C'mon, I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake... But I'm surprised, you're very frank for a trained killer."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting the man behind the legend...but first, let me explain about your Soliton radar system."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"The bright dot in the middle is you Snake.  The red dots are your enemies and the blue cone shape represents their field of vision."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Be careful Snake. The Genome soldiers have highly developed senses of hearing and vision due to their gene therapy.  Make sure you don't let them see you."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"First I want you to infiltrate the disposal site and look for the DARPA Chief."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The DARPA Chief was injected with the same GPS transmitting nanomachines as you."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"He should appear on your radar as a green dot."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Get whatever information you can from him about the terrorists.  If he's alive that is..."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Snake, your radar isn't affected by the weather, but if you're discovered by an enemy you won't be able to use it."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Yes, it gets jammed easily I'm afraid."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Yes, it's all made from currently existing technology.  You won't be able to use it in an area with strong harmonic resonance.  So be careful."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We'll be monitoring your movements by radar... so contact us by Codec anytime  you want."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Got it.  I'll call if I'm feeling lonely."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Seriously Snake.  We're here to back you up, so call if you need some information or advice."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"I'm also in charge of your mission data.  Contact me if you want me to record your current status.  My frequency is 140.96.  It's a dedicated frequency for saving data.  Don't forget it."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Remember, except for your binoculars you're naked.  You need to arm yourself with whatever weapons you can find."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember.  First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here, and then all my weapons are taken away.  Imagine yourself put in that position."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Well, if yck in one you make it back in one piece, maybe I'll let you do a strip search on me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll hold you to that doctor.  By the way, sorry to dissapoint you but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"How did you do that?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"In my stomach.  Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach acids."},{"character":"Mei Ling","line":"Cigarettes?  How are those going to help you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You never know."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"If you want to get in, there's the front door."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake pulls out his binoculars and takes a look.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"It's the fastest way, but there's too much risk of being spotted by the enemy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't just knock on the door and ask them to let me in.  One sentry on the left and one on the right.  They're armed with \"five five sixers\" and pineapples..."},{"character":"action","line":"(As the guard on the right approaches Snake puts back his binoculars and hides behind the crate again.  Then he goes over to the left and pulls out his binoculars again.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"What about the air duct near the door?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake locates the duct but it is guarded, he pans up to the upper level of the facility.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"There should also be a duct on the second floor."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake looks across to the walkway on the second floor to find the vent but his view is blocked by the railing.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't see it from here."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake lowers his binoculars and once again hides behind the crate.)"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'll let you decide the best COA.  I'm counting on you Snake."},{"character":"action","line":"(The game resumes and the player takes control.  Eventually, Snake enters the vent on the second floor of the facility, he gets a codec call from Master Miller, his old instructor.)"},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake, it's been a long time."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Master?

Try to contact her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'll contact her right away.  But tell me... If this doesn't work, is there some other way to prevent the missile launch?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Hmmm.  You need to find Hal Emmerich, one of my employees."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who's that?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"The team leader of the Metal Gear Rex project.

We live in an age when any small country can have a nuclear weapons program."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about the other superpowers?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Russia and China still maintain a signifigant nuclear presence. Complete nuclear disarmament is an impossibility.  To maintain our own policy of deterrance, we need a weapon of overwhelming power."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean Metal Gear."},{"character":"Baker","line":"You know our industry suffered quite a blow as a result of the cut-backs in military budgets, due to this so called \"peace\"."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I remember hearing a lot about mergers and take-overs among the big weapons makers."},{"character":"Baker","line":"Yes.  And after my company lost their bid to produce the Air Force's next fighter jet, the Metal Gear project was out last ace in the hole.  That's why we pushed to have Metal Gear developed as a black project."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Black project?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"Secret projects paid for by the Pentagon's black budget.

This is the only remaining copy of the data."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What kind of data?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"All the data collected from this exercise.  Don't play dumb.  I know you were sent to get this.  I hid it from that sadistic maniac while he was torturing me.  They don't know that this disk exists. Make sure that you report this to Jim... to your boss.  I'll give you my card too.  It'll open up all level two security doors."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Can you walk?"},{"character":"Baker","line":"...No ...You go on without me.

And that's why we can't let the terrorist attack go public."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"We still haven't even ratified Start 2 or dealt with the issue of TMDs.

Is there any way to prevent it?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It seems there's some type of emergency override device that can cancel out the detonation code.

War is no reason to end a friendship."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's insane."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I first met him on the battlefield.  He was being held a prisoner of Outer Heaven.

I was still green and he showed me the ropes."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You knew him well?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No.  We never talked about our personal lives.

Why did you get into genetic research anyway?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I never knew who my parents were or even what they looked like. I guess I got into genetics because I wanted to figure out why I'm the way I am."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So you studied about DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yeah.

I thought that by analyzing a person's genetic information, I could retrieve the blank spots in that person's memory."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Memory is stored in DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"We're not sure.

Without her, we can't complete this mission."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I knew it.  You're hiding something."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Give me some time.  I'll try to get it out of her..."},{"character":"Master","line":"Hurry then.  We've got to find out who she is and what she's doing here."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I understand.  Snake, give me some time."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I don't have any time left for you."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake signs off and heads into the room where Metal Gear REX is stored. Otacon calls on the Codec.)"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Snake... it's me."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What's wrong?  Did you find a good place to hide?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah, thanks to the stealth gear.  It looks like they've finished getting Metal Gear ready."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How do you know that?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"I overheard them talking.  Where are you now?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Right in front of Metal Gear... but it's strange."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"What is?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's nobody here... no guards, nobody patrolling... it's too quiet."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Maybe because they're all ready.  They said they even input the PAL codes."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What should I do?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"All we can do is use the override system that President Baker told you about."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But I've only got one of the three keys.  And besides that, like Ocelot said, there's some trick to using the keys..."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Leave it to me..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You got some kind of plan?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Well, I'm in the computer roo right now.  I'm trying to access Baker's private files."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Baker's files?  Don't you need a password?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Of course.  But there are ways..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Are you a hacker?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yup.  That describes me pretty well."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Does it look like you can get in?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"I don't know yet.  I'll give it a try."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I'm counting on you..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake signs off.  Otacon calls later with an update.)"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"It's me again."},{"character":"Snake","line":"How's it going?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Hmmm... not bad.  I just got past his third security level.  He was a pretty careful guy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do you think you'll break in soon?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"I've never met a system I couldn't bust into."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, keep trying."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake signs off again and later Otacon calls again.)"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Snake, I did it!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You got past security?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Bingo!!!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Great.  So whaddya got?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"I accessed the confidential Metal Gear file."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So what about the PAL override system that Baker talked about?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"I haven't found it yet."},{"character":"Snake","line":"That's what I need to know!"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"But Snake, I found something else!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"The secret behind the new nuclear weapon!  Just as I thought, the nuclear warhead is designed to be fired from the rail gun, like a projectile... It doesn't use fuel so it isn't considered a missile. That way it can get around all sorts of international treaties."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Pretty sneaky."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yes, but effective.  And that's not even the scariest thing about this weapon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I can't wait to hear this."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"It's a stealth weapon!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean it won't show up on radar?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah.  The truth is... they've been working on a stealth missile since the late 70's."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why weren't they able to develope one until now?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Because of the missile's rocket propulsion system... it will be picked up by enemy satellites."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Oh yeah, that makes sense."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"But unlike a missile, the rail gun doesn't burn any propellant.  So it can't be detected by any current ballistic missile detection systems."},{"character":"Snake","line":"An invisible nuclear warhead..."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Totally impossible to intercept.  And on top of that, it's got a surface piercing warhead designed to penetrate hardened underground bases."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We learned that lesson in the Gulf War."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"This thing could mean the end of the world!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"It's the ultimate weapon.  And from a political point of view, it avoids the problem of nuclear reduction and nuclear inspections. Colonel, is this true?  Are you listening?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm listening..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"If word of this got out, it could delay the signing of the Start 3 Treaty and cause a huge international incident."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah, it would be nasty.  The United States would be denounced by the UN... it could even bring the President down..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did you know this, Colonel?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm sorry..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You've changed, Colonel."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I won't make any excuses..."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Snake, listen to me.  This new nuclear weapon... it's never actually been tested, only simulated."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean they ran a computer model?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah, that's why they were conducting this excercise.  They needed to get actual data to back up the simulation."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What were the results of the excercise?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"It looks like it went better than they hoped for.  But...I can't find the data anywhere on this network.  You'd think that data as important as that would be carefully recorded..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"It was.  President Baker gave me an optical disc with all of the test data."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"What!? Do you still have it?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No, Ocelot took it from me."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Damn..."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"The terrorists have replaced the dummy warhead with a real warhead. Once they input the detonation codes, they should be ready to launch."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So you think they can do it?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Well the dummy warhead was designed to be identical to the real thing, so I think so."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Did you find out how to override it yet?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Not yet.  It must be in a separate file.  Right now, I'm looking through all of Baker's personal files."},{"character":"Snake","line":"We're counting on you..."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake enters the control center of the Rex hangar.  He sees Liquid and Ocelot talking.)"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Okay. I've entered the PAL codes and disengaged the safety device. We can launch anytime."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"There's still no response from Washington. It looks like we'll have to show them that we mean business."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Should I set it for Chernoton, Russia?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"No, there's been a change. The new target is...Lopnor, China."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Why Boss?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"I'm sure neither you nor Mr. Gurlukovich would really like to see a nuclear bomb dropped on your Motherland, right?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Liquid!"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"But why? There's nothing there."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Wrong. It's a nuclear test site."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"A nuclear test site?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"If we nuke a major population center, the game's over... But a nuclear explosion at a test site can still be concealed from the public. Meanwhile Washington will be worried about the retaliatory strike from China."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"That'll probably mean top secret talks between both countries' leaders..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Of course. And in the process, the President will be forced to divulge the existence of a new and highly destabilizing nuclear weapon to the Chinese. What do you think that will do to the U.S.'s reputation? Or the President's?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"And with the CTBT, that means that China and India... I see..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Yes. When the other countries hear about this new weapon, they'll all want to contact us. Washington won't be very happy when we start selling their own system to the highest bidders. Yes. The President will break. He will give in to our demands."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Big Boss's DNA and one billion dollars..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"One billion dollars!"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"That money will be used to cure our genome soldiers as well. I'm also including the FoxDie vaccine in our demands."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"FoxDie... It killed Octopus and the ArmsTech president... So it's true that it affects older people first. Mantis might not have been affected because he wore a mask."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Wolf wasn't infected either. Perhaps due to those tranquilizers she always took."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Something to do with the adrenaline level in the blood? Or maybe it's just because this FoxDie was still experimental and they haven't worked out all the bugs yet..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"In any case, have you heard from your friend, Colonel Sergei Gurlukovich at the Spetznaz?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"He still has doubts about the ability of Metal Gear. He said we can talk after Metal Gear's test launch is successful."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"He is a very prudent man."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"There's nothing to worry about. The Colonel wants Metal Gear and the new nuclear weapon so bad he can taste it. If Russia wants to regain its position as a military superpower, they need to reinforce their nuclear arsenal. They need a nuclear weapon that can't be intercepted. Metal Gear will allow them to gain first strike capability over the rest of the world."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Their regular army is in shambles and they think they can restore their country's military power with nuclear weapons? Gurlukovich... he's no warrior... he is a politician."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"But he's the one who gave us the Hind and most of our other heavy firepower."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"He's got over a thousand soldiers under his command. If we joined forces we could put up quite a resistance here. Since Mantis died, the genome soldiers' brainwashing has started to wear off. I'm worried about the men's morale. An alliance with the Russians would boost that as well..."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"What are you saying?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"We're not going anywhere. We're going to dig in here."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"We could still escape..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"We've got the most powerful weapon ever made and we're about to ally with Gurlukovich's forces."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Are you going to fight the whole world?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"And what's wrong with that? We can launch a nuclear warhead at any target on this planet... A nuclear warhead invisible to radar. And on top of that, this base is full of spare nuclear warheads. Once we get the DNA and the money, the world will be ours!"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"What about your promise to Colonel Gurlukovich?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"I have no interest in the revival of Mother Russia."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"...You're not thinking of reviving Big Boss's dream?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"From today, ...call this place \"Outer Heaven\"."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Big Boss's dream..."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"But Boss,... you're not worried about the PAL being overridden? If the code is entered again, it'll be deactivated."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"No need to worry. The DARPA Chief and the ArmsTech president are both dead."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Does Snake know how the override system works?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"You interrogated him. Don't you know?"},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"He didn't have any keys on him."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Good. Then no one can stop Metal Gear now."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"By the way, what should we do with that woman? Want me to kill her?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Let her live. She's Campbell's niece and Snake cares for her... We'll keep her as our ace in-the-hole."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Meryl... she's alive."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Snake, I found Baker's top-secret files!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Great job."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"How's it going there?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"They've finished inputting the PAL codes. So how do we deactivate them?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Okay...y'see the override system that the president was talking about... It can also be used to input the detonation codes. Y'see if you insert the keys when the warhead is active, you deactivate it. And if you insert them when it's inactive, it becomes activated. And you can only use the keys once."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Only once, huh."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah...you'd better get started. We don't have much time."},{"character":"Snake","line":"But it takes three keys, right!? I've only got one of them!"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Hold on a minute. Y'see that's the trick. You already have all three keys!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"The card key is made of a shape memory alloy."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Shape memory alloy?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yes. It's a material that changes shape at different temperatures. The key is made out of it!"},{"character":"Snake","line":"This card key?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Yeah. The card key changes shape at different temperatures."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So this key is actually three keys in one...clever."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Can you see the input terminals in the center of the Control Room..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I see them."},{"character":"Otacon","line":"Those three laptop terminals are for the emergency input. There should be a symbol on each screen... Each symbol corresponds to a different key. Input the keys in order from left to right. The left one's for the room temperature key. See the symbol? Next to that goes the low temperature key. The one on the right is the high temperature key."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, I got it. First I change the shape of the card and then I input them in order, right?"},{"character":"Otacon","line":"That's right. All you do is insert the card keys. After you insert the key into the module, a hard disk reads the information contained on it. Once you've finished with all three terminals, the code input process is complete. But here's the thing. You can only use the key three times. It's an emergency system and it's only meant to be used once."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"The world is riding on that key, Snake."},{"character":"Ocelot","line":"Who's that!!"},{"character":"action","line":"(Ocelot fires a bullet at Snake.  Snake is startled and loses his grip on the key.  It tumbles over the railing and falls into the drainage ditch.)"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Damn!! The key fell in the drainage ditch!"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Snake!! This is bullet-proof glass! There's no way in! I'll enjoy watching you die!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, you've got to get that key!"},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake finds the key and heads back up to the control room to input the code.)"},{"character":"Computer","line":"PAL code number one confirmed. Awaiting PAL code number two..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, that takes care of PAL code number one... Now PAL number two... freeze the key."},{"character":"Computer","line":"PAL code number two confirmed. Awaiting PAL code number three..."},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake. It's about Naomi Hunter..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Then you should talk to the Colonel. He's looking into it."},{"character":"Master","line":"Turn your monitor off."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay it's off. No one else can hear us. Go ahead."},{"character":"Master","line":"Sorry, but I didn't want the Colonel to hear."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay, so what's up?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I've got a good friend in the Pentagon..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah..."},{"character":"Master","line":"He's the one who told me about it... It looks like the DIA recently developed a new type of assassination weapon."},{"character":"Snake","line":"An assassination weapon?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake, have you ever heard of something called \"Fox Die\"?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"No..."},{"character":"Master","line":"Fox Die?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...Liquid and others were talking about it..."},{"character":"Master","line":"Yeah. It's some kind of virus that targets specific people. I don't know all the details, but..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What are you trying to say?"},{"character":"Master","line":"It's too similar."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What is!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"The cause of death. Didn't the ArmsTech president and the DARPA Chief, I mean Decoy Octopus,... die of something that looked like a heart attack?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Yeah...?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Well, apparently Fox Die kills its victims by simulating a heart attack."},{"character":"Snake","line":"No... You're telling me that Naomi was behind it?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Snake, try to remember. Did Naomi give you some kind of injection?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...The nanomachines."},{"character":"Master","line":"She was in the best position to have done it, but I don't know what her motive was."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...Does the Colonel know?"},{"character":"Master","line":"I'm not sure. But he still hasn't questioned her."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Okay. I'll ask him myself. Colonel, what's new with the Naomi situation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I just placed Naomi under arrest."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Arrest?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"She was sending coded messages towards the Alaskan base. I didn't want to believe it, but she must be working with the terrorists."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Are you sure?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I'm afraid so. She's being interrogated now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What kind of interrogation?"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Well...I'd like to avoid the rough stuff, but we don't even have any sodium pentathol here."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Call me if you find out anything."},{"character":"Master","line":"So it's true, isn't it?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi...I can't believe it."},{"character":"Master","line":"That means the Fox Die vaccine must be around somewhere."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Listen. I've got bigger things to worry about."},{"character":"Master","line":"But Snake...you might be infected too, you know."},{"character":"Snake","line":"All I can do is leave it up to the Colonel."},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake goes to input the rest of the PAL Codes and during the process he gets a Codec call.)"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Snake, can you hear me?  It's Naomi..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi!? ...what the hell!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Campbell and the others are busy right now...I'm on a different Codec."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi, is what the Colonel says true?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...Yes.  But not everything I said was a lie. I don't know myself. I don't know my real name or even what my parents looked like.  I bought all my identification. But my reason for getting into genetics was true."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Cause you want to know yourself, right?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"That's right. I want to know where I came from...m...my age, my race... anything."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"I was found in Rhodesia sometime in the 80's... a dirty little orphan..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Rhodesia? What's now known as Zimbabwe?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. Rhodesia was owned by England until 1965 and there were lots of Indian laborers around.  That's probably where I got my skin color from, but I'm not even sure about that..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi, you're too worried about the past. Isn't it enough to understand who you are now?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Understand who I am now!?  Why should I? No one else tries to understand me.  I was alone for so long... until I met my big brother and him."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Your big brother?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes.... Frank Jaeger."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"He was a young soldier, when he picked me up near the Zambezi River.  I was half-dead from starvation and he shared his rations with me."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. Frank Jaeger, the man who you destroyed, was my brother and my only family."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Gray Fox?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"We survived that hell together, Frank and I.  He protected me. He's my one connection... the only connection that I have to my past."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And he brought you back to America?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"No.  I was in Mozambique when \"he\" came."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who is \"he\" ? ...You mean Big Boss?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"He brought us to this land of freedom , this America. But then he and my brother went back to Africa to continue the war.  And that's when it happened... You killed my benefactor and sent my brother home a cripple.  I vowed revenge and joined FOX-HOUND.  I knew it was my best chance to meet you and I prayed for the day that I ould..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So were your prayers answered?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. I waited two long years..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"To kill me?  Is that all you cared about?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Yes. That's right.  Two years.  You were all I thought about for two long years...like some kind of twisted obsession..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Do you still hate me?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...Not exactly.  I was partly wrong about you..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What about Liquid and the others?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"No. I'll have my revenge on them too."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Naomi...you didn't kill that doctor too, did you?  The one that used Gray Fox for his genome experiments..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...No...that was my brother.  Afterwards I covered it up and helped him hide out..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So that Ninja...I mean Gray Fox... he's come here to kill me?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...I don't think so.  I think he just came here to fight you... I wasn't sure before, but now I think I understand.  A final battle with you... that's all he lives for. I'm sure of it..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...Fox...no... Naomi, tell me something..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...about FoxDie?  FoxDie is a type of retrovirus that targets and kills only specific people.  First, it infects the macrophages in the victim's body.  FoxDie contains smart enzymes, created through protein engineering.  They're programmed to respond to specific genetic patterns in the cells."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Those enzymes recognize the target's DNA?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Right. They respond by becoming active, and using the macrophages, they begin creating TNF epsilon.  It's a type of cytokine, a peptide which causes cells to die.  The TNF epsilon is carried along the bloodstream to the heart, where they attach to the TNF receptors in the heart cells."},{"character":"Snake","line":"And then...they cause a heart attack?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"The heart cells suffer a shock and undergo an extreme apoptosis. Then... the victim dies."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Apoptosis...you mean the heart cells commit suicide... Naomi..."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"...What?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"...You must have programmed that thing to kill me too, right? Do I still have time? Naomi, I don't blame you for wanting me dead.  But I can't go yet. I still have a job to do."},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Listen, Snake.  I'm not the one who made the decision to use FoxDie."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You weren't?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"You were injected with FoxDie as a part of this operation. I just wanted to let you know that... No, that's not the whole truth... the real thing that I wanted to tell you was... Snake, I... I..."},{"character":"Voice","line":"Hey! What are you doing!?"},{"character":"Naomi","line":"Eeeek!!  Ooooh.... Snake....."},{"character":"Campbell","line":"...Snake, I can't allow Naomi to make any more unauthorized transmissions.  Naomi's been removed from this operation."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What happened to Naomi!? What did she mean when she said that FoxDie was a part of this operation!?  Colonel, let me talk to her!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"I won't. She's under arrest."},{"character":"Snake","line":"...you double crossed me!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Snake, there's no time for that!"},{"character":"Campbell","line":"Right now your job is to stop Metal Gear! ...Okay, Snake!?"},{"character":"action","line":"(Snake inputs the second PAL code.)"},{"character":"Computer","line":"PAL code number two conirmed.

Now the detonation code is completed. Nothing can stop Metal Gear now."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Master, what's going on?"},{"character":"Master","line":"You found the key and even activated the warhead for us too. I really must express my gratitude.  Sorry to have involved you in that silly shape memory alloy business.  We weren't able to learn the DARPA Chief's code.  Even with Mantis' psychic powers, he couldn't read his mind.  Then Ocelot accidentally killed him during the interrogation.  In other words, we weren't able to launch the nuclear device and we were all getting a little worried.  Without the threat of a nuclear strike, our demands would never be met."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What do you mean?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Without the detonation codes, we had to find some other way. That's when we decided...you might prove useful, Snake.  First I thought we might get the information from you, Snake.  So I had Decoy Octopus disguise himself as the DARPA Chief.  Unfortunately Octopus didn't survive the encounter. ...thanks to FoxDie."},{"character":"Snake","line":"You mean you had this planned from the beginning? Just to get me to input the detonation code!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"Huh? You didn't think you made it this far by yourself, did you?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Who the hell are you!?"},{"character":"Master","line":"In any case, the launch preparations are complete.

He's been dead for at least three days.  I didn't know because my Codec link with Master was cut off.

You'd point a weapon at your own brother?"},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why did you disguise yourself as Master?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"So I could manipulate you more easily. And you performed quite well I must say. Although the boys at the Pentagon are probably saying the same thing..."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What the hell are you talking about!?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Following orders blindly with no questions asked.

Are you telling me Naomi was working with the Pentagon?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"They thought she was. But it seems that Dr. Naomi Hunter couldn't be controlled so easily."},{"character":"Snake","line":"What?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"We've got a spy working in the Pentagon.

But I had no idea she was motivated by such petty revenge... we still don't know what changes she made to FoxDie's program. Oh well. It doesn't matter. I've already added the FoxDie vaccine to my list of White House demands."},{"character":"Snake","line":"There's a vaccine?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"There must be. But that woman is the only one who really knows. Anyway, it might prove to be unnecessary."},{"character":"Snake","line":"Why is that?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"You were successful in coming into contact with all of us, so we must have all been exposed to the virus. It's true that the ArmsTech president and Decoy Octopus were killed by FoxDie... But Ocelot, myself, and you, the carrier, were apparently unaffected."},{"character":"Snake","line":"A bug in the virus' programming?"},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Hmm, could be. In any case, if it doesn't kill you then I'm not worried either. After all, our genetic code is identical."},{"character":"Snake","line":"So it's true...you and I are..."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"Yes, twins, but we're not ordinary twins... we're twins linked by cursed genes.

The only reason I exist is so they could create you."},{"character":"Snake","line":"I was the favorite, huh."},{"character":"Liquid","line":"That's right! I'm just the leftovers of what they used to make you. Can you understand what it's like to know that you're garbage since the day you were born!?

You should know that as well as I do. After I launch this weapon and get our billion dollars, we'll be able to bring chaos and honor... back to this world gone soft.
